Unfortunately, this has developed into one of the worst experiences of my life. The follow-up was substandard from the start: from child psychologist to plastic surgery.

My future wish to have children was never taken into account. Prof. Monstrey followed me further within plastic surgery - a decision that I now consider to be the biggest mistake of my life. The communication was downright bad. The operation was eventually performed by a student under his supervision, and this went wrong. Numerous complications followed, and the urology team was completely ignored, resulting in even more problems on the urological level.

I was later promised corrections by the plastic team, once everything had healed. But those promises were not kept. I did not receive proper aftercare, which has now left me with trauma. Despite my fear, I returned to the plastic surgery department, with an appointment with Prof. Buncamper. He refused any form of correction, although this had been promised earlier. Instead, I received a card from a tattoo artist who could tattoo “realistically”. I could clearly see from the photos that it was a belly flap – when I mentioned this, I was immediately dismissed without explanation.

My attempts to seek help again always ended in disappointment. Even with the lymphatic doctor: my hand has been swollen for 10 years after the operation, but the doctor did not look at me and simply sent me away again. Once again I had gathered courage and made time – for nothing.

The treatment for nerve pain on the scars (via fat injections) also had no effect.

I advise everyone not to take this last step here at UZ Gent. Seek help in another hospital. What happened to me, I would not wish on anyone.","Translated by Google","・","See original (Dutch)","","","Share","",""

Subsequently, the ombudsman service also did not provide proper assistance. I am not in the habit of writing negative reviews (feel free to check my profile), but I see no other option than to warn others about this experience. For irregular and unexplained pain in my right ear, I made an appointment online at the ENT department and I was given an appointment with the doctor in question quickly. I was welcomed coldly, with hardly any contact being made and the gentleman mainly looked at his computer screen. Apparently my medical file was being looked at on Cozo all the time and this doctor opened a total of 11 documents (my own GP has never opened so many documents on this platform). He didn't actually listen to my story, but formed a picture based on all these documents. This includes an overview of the medications I took in the past. He asked me what medication I took and I answered honestly that I sometimes took some painkillers or anti-inflammatories. But he did not believe this because of my medication schedule that was open on the screen (which I could not see, it was set up that way). He forgot that there was also an end date for this medication. When he asked what medication I was taking, he did not accept my answer, but assumed that I was still taking all the medication listed. Apparently he could not or did not want to read that these were no longer taken and did not believe me. At this point he became verbally aggressive, his attitude became intimidating and I was basically humiliated. I was no longer believed in my story because of the tests that could not show anything and my medical past. A consultation five years earlier in another hospital was dragged into this whole and used against me. It was suggested (not literally said) by the man who calls himself a doctor that I had other problems. Since I didn't say what medication I was taking (which I did), he claimed I was acting like the medical expert in the room. This situation got completely out of hand. He came across as non-verbally deceptive because of his posture, his wide eyes, the gestures with his arms and his choice of words. I felt completely intimidated and unhelped. I also had the impression that he did not fully understand me, Dutch is clearly not his first language. When I talked about physical problems he clearly understood them as psychological ones. I was then virtually forced out of the practice without any prospects of help or treatment. At the end he literally said that the hospital services could learn from this experience by not taking someone in faster than me. I have no idea what I did to deserve this insult. I brought this entire story to the ombudsman service, but they could not tell me anything other than that they had forwarded the story to the doctor by email, but he did not respond. They went to report my story to the head of department, but here too I received no follow-up. And the ultimate sad thing is that I paid for this appointment. I have paid for this humiliation and still no relief from my pain.","Translated by Google","・","See original (Dutch)","","","Share","Like","1"

Little communication. Partly incompetent staff. After almost 1 week, my mother's medication was still not correctly included in the medication management. It took 5 days for the antidepressants she has been taking for 15 years to be noted. A known dermatological wound was treated, but the suture that was still there was apparently not noticed. No hand soap available in the room. No help with washing the first few days. My mother is hypersensitive and was in isolation for a contagious respiratory disease, but was in a room where the handle was broken, so the door had to be left ajar all the time. This was only resolved after 3 days even though it was during the week. In addition, my mother was taken out of bed at 7am with the message that she had a neighbor and had to wash quickly. This turned out to be a less gifted male patient in a room where there was no dividing curtain and the sink was in the room without a shield. Fortunately, the nurse intervened at this point. Only after 1 week of conversation with the doctor (the treating doctor had already left on leave, so only spoke to a replacement doctor. He was friendly and provided sufficient explanation. When transferred to a regional hospital, it was not communicated that my mother opted for a 1pk. She initially ended up on a 2pk and they did not have room on a 1pk for at least 1 week. In my opinion, a lot of mistakes happened during this admission.

I am curious about my adjusted bill and whether there are also extra costs

He was admitted to the ASZ of Geraardsbergen because we live not far from there and because he received chemotherapy there. The answer he got was ""we think it is a metastasis of the esophagus"", they could not say what the cause was. Before he was admitted, he first asked how long he had to live before the brain tumors would break out again, the answer we got from the oncologist was ""your life expectancy is until around summer, and with the radiation everything would go better again"". Of course this turned out not to be the case and I personally think that is something that is not possible, as an oncologist you should always be sure of your answer, and that was completely different here at the UZ Gent. Surgeon Hanne Vanomeslaeghe was able to tell us everything honestly and with certainty, so if you want honest answers about cancer, the UZ Gent is the perfect place for you. I think it would have been better if he had been treated there, but that is too late now.","Translated by Google","・","See original (Dutch)","","","Share","",""

The uzgent likes to charge extra costs and for very high amounts I have the impression (this is not the first time I have experienced that).

Last week my father spent three days in rehabilitation at the Ghent University Hospital after a knee prosthesis. Due to a shortage of places in the rehabilitation department, he was placed in another department. The care, and especially the pain management, was substandard.

(I am an emergency and intensive care nurse myself, and my father is a judge. I mention our professions explicitly because it seems as if some nurses are quick to make judgments and think that patients are exaggerating or seeking attention,...
My father was not taken seriously.)

1. Pain management and poor follow-up

The nurses' primary goal was to control my father's pain, but that didn't happen. He did not sleep a wink during his stay due to the enormous pain. This despite the fact that the attending physician had prescribed Oxynorm on the first day for use if necessary during his stay. My father was given this medication only once.
Why was receiving Oxynorm an absolute 'no-go' for the nurses, while this was explicitly allowed by the doctor?

In addition, my father was entitled to a new ice pack every two hours (at 2 a.m. and 4 a.m.), as it gets warm and is therefore no longer effective. However, he never received this during the night, even after he explicitly requested it from the night nurse, who replied bluntly: ""No, we're not going to do that, no time.""

2. Inconsistent policies regarding medication

The explanation my father received about his pain management differed per nurse. So many didn't seem to know that he could receive Oxynorm? Every request regarding this medication was always refused.
There was also a lot of confusion about whether or not to administer diclofenac. Some nurses refused to give this because of his hypertension, while others indicated that it was possible. The reason they gave for not giving it was because diclofenac can increase blood pressure, but this increase is minimal. In that case, why wasn't his blood pressure simply checked, instead of withholding this medication for no apparent reason?

In the end, my father only received paracetamol per os and very occasionally diclofenac, supplemented with an ice pack every now and then. This was completely inadequate considering the intensity of his pain, which was barely evaluated.

3. Neglect of other patients

Besides my father, there was another patient who was immobile. At one point this man urgently needed to urinate, but no urine bottle was provided. My mother reported this to a nurse who was at the computer, but she indicated that she had ""no time"" to help. My mother had to ask where the urine bottle was located so that she could give it to the patient. Unfortunately it was already too late; the patient had wet his bed. This could easily have been prevented with a little attention and care.

Conclusion

The care provided during my father's stay was far below standard. The lack of adequate pain control, ignoring doctor's orders, conflicting information about medication and the lack of basic care for other patients are not only worrying, but also unacceptable.

I am ashamed of how the nurses treated my father. This type of negligence and lack of care gives our profession a bad name.
Hopefully not all patients are treated in this way by the nurses involved. Fortunately, my father found two nurses who did their work with dedication and care, and he was satisfied with them.

Yours sincerely
Luke","Translated by Google","・","See original (Dutch)","","","Share","Like","1"

Previously had two successful operations in a regional hospital. In the hospital they would see whether plastic surgery would be an additional option.
Upon arrival it turned out that the provided medical file could not be found, the doctor and assistants in question behaved curtly and quite adhoc or aggressively. Before my treatment I had negative pressure therapy in a sealed cast. People were incensed that they had to remove the plaster cast...but without it they could not inspect the wound...so they had to remove it...that was not done without a struggle and with clear reluctance...they looked at the wound for a maximum of two minutes...all my questions were not answered (reasonably medically trained from home)..I was almost personally blamed for not having been involved in the healing process earlier...and then only had to make a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks. (involvement??) ...they turned out to be unable to change the negative pressure therapy while I had all the necessary bandages, etc. with me
had taken with me (?) and was also unable to place a new cast (because I would have had to make an appointment for a plaster room(?) to deal with it, an inferior connection was made with the message that I had to go back to my regional hospital for negative pressure therapy, wound care and a new cast..

Achilles tendon loss at the end of January. Went to UZ GENT ortho department. No surgery required.
Every month I saw another stupid ortho assistant who supposedly no longer did an ultrasound, barely looked at my foot, did not look at my file in advance, would let me walk even though I was not yet allowed, wrote off my 6 months of pain and inflammation as ""part of the healing process"" thanks to the assistants: DR. THOMAS DECOCK, DR . JULIEN VAN DEN BROUCKE, DR. GERT VAN DER VELDE, DR. ALEXANDER GALANT.
Fortunately, I was admitted to the Orthakliniek in Deurne today. 6 months of rehabilitation for nothing. Should have had surgery immediately.
So now after all these months back to square one and surgery or my foot is completely screwed up. Thanks to DR. VAN RENTERGHEM DEBBIE who was able to view all the ultrasounds and reports and thoroughly examined my foot.","Translated by Google","・","See original (Dutch)","","","Share","Like","5"

But sadly it didn’t work. I am giving a one star review because of how payments were handled, or rather not! Virtually no responses from invoicing dept when payments were queried. A couple of times we issued payments, with proof on our bank statements but got continually billed by invoicing for the same payments. I sent an email to invoicing and fertility dept highlighting my concerns but no response received. My husband tried using a payment link which didn’t work, he emailed to ask for help. No response received and we got a letter from bailiffs for payment because invoicing didn’t respond to his email!

Communication is just shocking. I suggest if you’re an international client you seriously consider if this is the hospital for your treatment, as we’ve found this experience very poor to say the least!!

Update 20th March
We’ve received another invoice!! No correspondence of what this relates to but codes which do not relate to any of our paperwork so do not understand why we were billed again! I emailed the ombudsman as you suggested asking for further information. Four weeks later no response from the ombudsman but a new bill. This was not from UZGhent but their bailiffs, yet again. BEYOND a joke! Why bother having email accounts if only to send emails but not respond? I want invoicing dept to call me urgently tomorrow. Kindly arrange this.","","","","","","Share","Like","3"

Pain that is unbearable and nothing has been done yet, well I've had it, all those investigations no longer reveal anything even though they know all too well what the problem is!! You don't walk around with the pain, otherwise you won't have to wait so long!

This year, I was diagnosed with congenital heart disease known as ""Sinus Venosus ASD,"" abbreviated as PAPVR + ASD. Despite being asymptomatic, the diagnosis came as a shock. I embarked on a journey of understanding my condition and exploring potential treatments.

Through extensive research and consultations with various surgeons, I discovered three surgical options available to me:

1. Sternotomy open-heart operation.
2. Thoracotomy minimal invasion.
3. Transcatheter minimal invasion.

Choosing the right approach was a challenging decision. I would strongly advise seeking detailed consultations with surgeons to thoroughly understand the associated risks before making a choice. In my case, I personally opted for option 1, as it seemed to offer a safer solution for my specific congenital condition.

Selecting a surgeon proved to be no less complex, given that I consulted with more than 8 specialists across different countries. The key is to establish the right connection with your chosen surgeon, for me this was with Prof. Dr. Katrien Francois at UZ Gent Hospital.
Now that I've been discharged from the hospital and back in the comfort of my home, I feel fantastic and healthy. Notably, I believe I have been left with the coolest and nearly invisible scar on my chest. I am truly grateful to Professor Francois and her dedicated team for providing exceptional care throughout my journey.

Thank you !!!","","","","","","Share","Like","2"

UZ is the only hospital we can go to for this, unfortunately we cannot go to Maria Middel Lares for this. From the 1st appointment there is already misery with the hospital, not keeping appointments, passing on/booking appointments incorrectly and simply not sending a confirmation email or text message, let alone sending a reminder, let them know and they will not reveal the error to you. that you don't have any problems with this and other hospitals are correct, they don't know what to say and they find this strange because no one has any problems. Now I call today when my daughter had her new appointment, since I didn't remember and I didn't have an email, I was told that an appointment has been scheduled with the doctor within 3 days. I was out of the blue for a while, just beginning. September and had to go back to the doctor in April, I needed an appointment for an injection and a blood test, they said that the appointment was on Tuesday, it was now Monday, I have no confirmation email, had no text message or telephone that there was an appointment on Tuesday . I then say, I want a new appointment, they just say you can listen on Wednesday when the doctor calls, I don't deal with the doctor, but with the nurse. so I stand my ground so I say no, I'm now making an appointment for my daughter, it didn't really make sense, normally I would receive a confirmation email tomorrow, I'm curious.

this hospital is for me 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 worth stars
If I had to go to another hospital, I would do so immediately, they cannot give proper appointments, the doctor cannot deal with children, you do not tell a girl of almost 10 years that she is too heavy, a child can develop an eating disorder like this

and in short, the doctor simply makes appointments with parents of which both have not been informed, I have a feeling that this is what happens, the doctor sets appointments in order to have time for himself, if I want it a bit quieter then I take leave from the doctors, this apparently works differently they book so-called patients

This is certainly not the best hospital, on the contrary for me this is the worst hospital ever, it is clear why this is called the cheapest hospital","Translated by Google","・","See original (Dutch)","","","Share","Like","9"

We were sent to UZ Gent, came from AZ Delta.

AZ Delta had also called UZ to explain everything and make an appointment.

We arrived at the people we had to be with, one friendlier than the other.

The first question was ""what can I do for you""?

Bizarre that you didn't get any information from Az Delta. Az Delta had already explained everything and now we had to do it again.

Wow, I had imagined the first visit differently. Hopefully it will improve as we go there..","Translated by Google","・","See original (Dutch)","","","Share","Like","4"

There is NO structure in the organization at the various counters, which apparently communicate very poorly with each other.
Here everything goes wrong, people are put on hold in the waiting room and you see +30 patients after you being treated earlier.
The nursing staff takes over places where patients will lie down after surgery, this is because the old staff cannot handle the faster system and let patients make their own plans. There was no fresh clothing for surgery, what we received had already been used. Here you will find proof that you do NOT have to look for respect for nursing in corona times.

To me it is not worthy of that name. Here you are just a number. The well-being of the patient is not important at all, they are only after your money. Firstly, the hospital is terribly poorly organized and the communication between the services is also substandard. You are simply sent from here to there without any results, with extremely long waiting times in between. Especially a very bad experience with doctor ARNE BURSSENS (orthopaedist). I had a problem in both feet. The doctor didn't even think it was necessary to look at my feet (he remained sitting behind his desk) or to refer me ?!!!!! He diagnosed me with tarsal tunnel on both feet which in retrospect was completely wrong!! He didn't even bother to look at the results of my previous tests... Ultimately, after a long wait, I ended up in the pain clinic where the nurse at the counter was extremely unfriendly. They had tried a treatment and it did not work and she informed me in a very unfriendly way that she could not help me further and that I had to look for other solutions myself... Ultimately I ended up at a private clinic in Melle where I was listened to and where the doctor gave me a completely different and this time correct diagnosis and without long waiting times. My advice: DO NOT go to a university hospital and certainly not UZ-Gent. A smaller clinic makes more effort and it goes much smoother and faster.","Translated by Google","・","See original (Dutch)","","","Share","Like","14"

They should have told me that in advance, then I wouldn't have come to spend the whole day with them from one service to the next.  Then you contact us at the beginning of March and they apologize that the patient stop has been extended until September, or perhaps until next year, they couldn't say.  You will then receive an invoice, which I of course protested for half-care.  If there is no follow-up, they should not charge anything because the first examination is pointless, even a small child understands that.  They do not agree with my protest and I am waiting for my response to it.  In short, not professional, no follow-up or solution... I recommend going elsewhere if you want good care","Translated by Google","・","See original (Dutch)","","","Share","Like","8"

But when it comes to parking it is a disaster. Physical medicine (for people with injuries and trauma to the musculoskeletal system) has no (!) parking! My mother has 3 fractures in the back and 1 in the ankle, so she can only walk a short distance. But parking at that service is not possible. So you have to use the tower parking which is often full, and is usually not an option and is a few hundred meters from the entrance of physical medicine.  So, there is no other option for me than to park illegally to get as close as possible to my mother. Then you run the risk of your car being towed. And that for people with limited mobility! Time for something to be done about this. There is a completely grassy area at the entrance to physical medicine.

It is managed in a rather old-fashioned, bureaucratic way with too little respect for the patient/customer. For example, the hospital cancelled one of appointment for my son and rescheduled a new one at a time which was not convenient for us without informing us. So, we only found out on the day when the appointment was initially scheduled after having taken a half-day off work and driven all the way from Brussels to Ghent. The hospital supposedly sent us a letter whihc we never received...and who still sends letters nowdays anyway? !

No matter which staff member of UZ Gent, the people still work here with a sparkling passion!

The staff here is very dynamic and sympathetic; they work here professionally with heart and soul. As a patient and/or visitor you will already notice the presence of skilled hands combined with a lot of knowledge and understanding.

No other hospital, anywhere, can match all of you in the UZ Gent Team! Your generally people-friendly, helpful hearts have already healed many ailments and wounds!
Likewise, all doctors and medical staff, from whatever service (blood collection service, PoliBas, orthopedic secretariat, internal care department of orthopedics staff, etc.) are like no other place in Belgium - I scoured enough hospitals to find out about this. to dare to express - so competent, so progressive and at the same time passionately working for people. Unlike other hospitals, human well-being is still central here. My sincere compliments to the general directors who do a fantastic job with their 'screenwork'!

The tram line stops in the center at the UZ Gent domain. (See attached photo)

The most specialized loving and aesthetically beautiful children's hospital is also located there. (see attached photo(s))

The parking has become financially ticket-friendly. Let this also mean a budgetary plus. More information can be found at the UZ Gent information desk or on the general UZ Gent number.

Healthy regards,

Yoeka & Ann Loffens
And Kris, my dear friend who turned out to be overenthusiastic about UZ Gent.","Translated by Google","・","See original (Dutch)","","","Share","Like","10"

He did such a great job of treating/reshaping the breast where there was a fairly large carcinoma by cutting away everything around the bad tissue and then sewing the tissues back together, so that the shape of the breast is normal again!
The only thing I was left with was a scar, because the armpit glands were removed as a precaution.
The nursing staff was extremely competent and very friendly: I felt excellent there, to the extent possible...
In the meantime, I read that there are black viewers, that they present themselves to the Jan Yperman hospital, they cannot read photos there!
