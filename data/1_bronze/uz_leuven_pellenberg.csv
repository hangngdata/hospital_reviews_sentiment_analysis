How they treated my father there is really disrespectful... They call it a rehabilitation center there, but they don't do much rehabilitation there... There were even days a week when they simply didn't do any exercises and when they did, fifteen minutes max. half an hour... That's not what I call rehabilitation... Not to mention some nurses: unfriendly, incompetent and communication with the family was nil... The day that he was allowed to go home, much too early of course and he thought so too, he was not even allowed in his room in the afternoon, because there was already another patient in his bed... They had just put his things in the hallway... This is really not possible... Do you really have no respect for the older people... But yes, the only thing that matters to them is the cash register... NOT RECOMMENDED!!!","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (Dutch)","Ó£ú","Like","Ó†ç","Share","",""

Since there are no more doctors there, everyone there LITERALLY does their WAY! decisions are literally made in the patient's place. Had a collision with a nurse who cannot understand that you don't treat people that way, let alone have a little empathy for a chronic care recipient and then say that you are no longer welcome there... Congratulations to UZ Leuven, I would say! This is how you should continue to do so!
If after 3 months you still have no news about fitted support stockings, support stockings that are broken, I find this distressing, I am 40 and 90 years old and this behavior still disappoints me very much (I am a VPK myself) and I do NOT treat my pat like that!!!

I probably didn't have the time to consult my agenda. The operator stated that it was difficult for me and immediately placed in September 2024. Empathy, friendliness with older people (as opposed to oncology) do not seem to me to be the strongest point of the reception. There is a reception assistant who clearly does not do her job with the appropriate empathy and understanding for the patient. Absolutely not recommended and not just because of the waiting times. Now we just hope that people read the similar complaints and do something about it.
