I also felt the manner of conveying information was quite insensitive. I feel ƒ± couldn‚Äôt have any nuanced discussion on my input/questions.

If I had had the choice, I would not have gone back this year. The follow-up is drastically lacking in humanity.

A question asked, a request for information, even a very simple one, results in a phone appointment and a bill. I was well aware that this was a business, but this is disgusting. My file was very poorly managed. Two days before the transfer, the lab was supposed to call me to confirm the transfer. No one called. I called several times without a response. In such a process, it is unacceptable to leave women in total disarray. 15 days later, I am not pregnant. A woman called me to say, ""Bad news! You're not pregnant! Would you like to reschedule?"" I told her I was waiting to hear about the other embryos so I could see if another appointment was necessary. To which she replied, ""You'll receive a letter. I'll let you call us back to reschedule. Have a great day!""

I received a one-line letter two weeks later and no medical report announcing the destruction of all the remaining embryos. It's a bit of a long wait when they can simply tell me over the phone. I guess they don't want to be burdened with the patients' feelings. I had to follow up every other day for a month to get an explanation and an apology, and I just received a new bill for the doctor's apologetic call.

I don't question the doctors' competence, but both of my experiences were extremely violent on a human level.

If my story can help other women avoid going through a similar experience, it will at least have helped in some way.","Ó£ú","Ó†ç","Share","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (French)","",""

On May 27th, around noon, I went to the UZ Brussels Emergency Room due to very intense intestinal pain, to the point where I could barely walk. The situation was extremely difficult, both physically and emotionally.

After the administrative formalities, I was treated by a young man who showed no professionalism. I, as the patient, had to ""guide"" him, which was completely unacceptable. He then disappeared without explanation, leaving me alone for 50 minutes in an examination room, without any communication or follow-up.

I could hear the emergency room doctors talking in the hallway while I stood there, helpless. I finally spoke to them myself to let them know I had been there for an hour. It was only then that an emergency room doctor came in and concluded, without any real examination, that I ""wasn't sick."" No blood test was performed, even though this is a fundamental basic examination in this type of situation. I wasted nearly four hours for nothing.

I finally went to another hospital, Brugmann Hospital, where I immediately had a blood test, a urine test, and an X-ray. It turned out that my intestines were obstructed and my blood showed a clearly elevated inflammatory level. UZ Brussels completely abandoned me. They didn't even provide basic medical care; a simple blood test, which is essential in emergencies, wasn't even performed.

Poor communication, a lack of professionalism, and a passive attitude seem to be the norm there. An emergency department like the one at UZ Brussels should be ashamed of providing such deplorable care. No concrete action has been taken. I was literally told that ""if we had to take a blood test from everyone, it wouldn't be feasible"" and that I ""didn't look sick."" Who are you to judge a person's health based solely on their appearance? If I come to the emergency room, it's for a serious reason.

The staff, or rather the students who circulate there, seemed extremely incompetent to me. I will never set foot in your chaotic emergency department again. Urgently reconsider your priorities.","Ó£ú","Ó†ç","Share","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (French)","",""

Our 8-year-old son had an appointment for his circumcision at 12:00 noon. Because the procedure is performed under general anesthesia, he was not allowed to eat anything from 7:00 in the morning and drink until 11:30 (with only a little until 10:00, to be safe). He did not go into the operating room for the anesthesia until 17:00. It unnecessarily made our child suffer for five more hours without food and drink, which is unacceptable.

Why make an appointment at 12:00, if he has to wait so long? We were finally allowed to go home around 22:00, without a pediatrician to advise us or a certificate of absence from school. We were not given help to get to the exit and had to climb the stairs with a fresh wound on his genitals ‚Äî which is downright barbaric.

The nurse advised us to go to the emergency room to get a certificate for school and to get additional information about the treatment. After the hurdles of getting there, we were told that I had to register again for a consultation in the emergency room, which would mean another two hours of waiting. I explained that we had been in the hospital since 11:30, that my son still had a wound and that the staff was not doing anything about it. They laughed at us and refused to call a pediatrician for us alone.

Exhausted, irritated and with my son just out of anesthesia, we left for home without any help. This was especially frustrating because our vehicle was at the pediatric ward, where we had to register. On the street, on foot, because all other exits were closed after 22:00, we had to walk to our vehicle with a bloody wound in the genitals ‚Äî an absurd situation.

You would expect a university hospital to function at a professional level, especially in terms of organization. Instead, blunder after blunder is made. This is not the first time I have had such experiences, but because my son has been so badly affected, I feel compelled to share my story.

If you think another hospital is better, chances are you will be more satisfied there.","Ó£ú","Ó†ç","Share","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (Dutch)","Like","1"

1 star is still too much.
I went for a day admission. The nurse makes you sign a paper that you agree to the operation just before you are taken to the operating room (you are already lying in a hospital bed). Why can't you do that in advance?
You don't get to see or speak to a doctor, not before the operation. And even less so after the operation. Not a word in the operating room either.
You are just a number.
I asked for a light anaesthetic. But the result was that I was anaesthetised for almost 4 hours, for a 40-minute procedure. I probably got an overdose of propofol. It was 6 pm when I woke up. At that moment, of course, there was no more doctor to be seen. The nurse threw me out of the recovery room as quickly as possible. This is totally irresponsible for a patient who has just woken up from anaesthesia. I only heard from the doctor after 3 days and that was after I had filed a complaint with the ombudsman because I felt that my rights as a patient had been violated.
Due to the heavy anesthesia that they gave me without asking, I now have memory loss.

Huge ear infection (see photos: D1 and D5 - hospital discharge) following a new piercing, and already on antibiotics for 6 days, with no improvement, quite the contrary!

I was directly in contact with an ENT who decided to make an incision to remove the infection which had been stored for days (a good week)! - Medical procedure already requested 3 days earlier in another hospital which refused it to me because supposedly ‚Äúwe never make an incision or puncture in an ear‚Äù! -

Unfortunately for me, the infection had already gone down into the blood so I had to be hospitalized. I had the opportunity to see the ENT in question every morning of my hospitalization, with clear follow-up (the doctor knows the situation), without passing through the hands of various ENTs.

The nurses were gentle and attentive, always worried about whether I had everything I needed. The ENT was always very clear in his explanations and medical actions towards me.

The food was good, the shower water hot, the room cleaned daily, the bed made again every morning, etc.

The decision was always made in my presence: the explanation of why I was kept for another day, and on the day of my release, the ENT was very attentive to my desire to leave, and given the improvement in my situation, accepted my release. I found it very appreciable!

Living in the Li√®ge region, UZ is far from home, but if I had to go back there, I would without hesitation.

Little advice: the doctor should also look at the end of the day at the results of the various examinations carried out during the day (blood test, smears, etc.) to put in place the ad hoc solution to the health problem as quickly as possible (e.g. targeted bacteria - appropriate antibiotic requested - first dose by the patient in the evening and not just the next afternoon).","Ó£ú","Ó†ç","Share","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (French)","",""

Today, my 18 month old daughter still has a high fever (39.5) and has been for 3 days, my pediatrician was not available urgently. So I'm going to throw it away, to my greatest regret. We arrived during lunchtime. Person. But NOBODY. 1h30 with a child who is 39.5 years old, screaming in pain in a waiting room. I finally left and my pediatrician was able to accommodate me. But I will learn the lesson. It‚Äôs promised! That said, they had the nerve to send me a bill, so I wanted to cancel it but since my daughter went through the first waiting room, they forced me to pay. What I did.

I called the hospital because it was an error on their part and there was no doctor on call in this department.

This is unacceptable, there is already a file in her name in this hospital, this is where the ambulance took her after her accident.

She was vomiting and she had heavy stomachache. We arrived at 22:00. They checked the temperature and sent us in the waiting room. At 24:00, the fever started again, my daughter vomited in the waiting room. Nobody cared. Finally someone came, after I started to make some waves, gave my daughter dafalgan and they sent us to a separate room. At 2 o‚Äôclock a young lady came, checked my daughter and said I should go home and give her perdolan and nurofen. If I really want, they can take blood to run some tests, but I need to wait until 5 o‚Äôclock for the results. I have waited another half hour for someone to come to take the blood. The fever was raising, my daughter was very tired. It‚Äôs not human possible to keep a child so many hours without making some tests. If they would have taken blood when we arrived, by 24-1 o‚Äôclock the results would have been ready and they could have give us a diagnosis. Shame on them.

The nursing staff were unprofessional and unempathetic. When I asked for help, I felt like I was bothering me, like they were doing me a favor rather than fulfilling their mission. They stayed in their room talking among themselves, while the patients waited, suffering in uncertainty. It is obvious that efficiency and attention to patient needs are not their priority.

I am writing again to express my deep concern and dissatisfaction regarding the treatment my mother received during her stay in the geriatrics department of your establishment. She was admitted there because of a broken hip and a collapsed vertebra, leaving her almost unable to walk.

Unfortunately, we were confronted with behavior that I consider unacceptable from some nurses. My mother, who already has difficulty expressing herself in French, was systematically addressed in Dutch, although the staff spoke French perfectly. This created an unnecessary and unfair communication barrier.

Additionally, I have witnessed behavior that I would describe as abuse. My mother was pushed in the back with a clenched fist, forcing me to intervene and warn the staff that I would not hesitate to contact the appropriate authorities if such acts happened again. Furthermore, his cell phone was hidden, preventing him from contacting me to report these incidents.

These experiences shocked me deeply. I would like to emphasize that I am not generalizing about all staff, but the actions of certain team members have seriously damaged our confidence in your establishment. A nurse's use of the term ""Dutch-speaking factory"" to describe the hospital was also particularly disturbing.

I ask you to take these concerns and the many opinions of all these people who have commented on their experiences in this hospital seriously and to conduct a thorough investigation into these incidents. It is essential that every patient, regardless of language or origin, is treated with dignity and respect. I am convinced that corrective measures are necessary to ensure that such situations do not recur.","Ó£ú","Ó†ç","Share","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (French)","",""

The nurses kept saying you can go home if you want, and ask your GP for your results.
I come home with intense pain. The next day I contacted the hospital to ask to send me the results so that I could go to a doctor on call (because my doctor does not work on weekends). Very unpleasant on the phone telling me that they cannot transfer my results to me and that in any case it was nothing serious.
I went to an on-call doctor who sent me to the hospital in Asse.
I am taken care of immediately upon my arrival at the Asse hospital.
I was transferred to Aalst for an appendicitis operation.
A few hours later I had surgery.

During my visit, I collapsed on the floor, clearly in difficulty, and asked for help. Instead of support, I was met with complete indifference and unacceptable contempt from the staff. The emergency nurse responded to me in a condescending tone: ""Come on, madam, get up, you can do it yourself."" There was no gesture of help or even consideration.

Later, during a blood test, I fainted. Here again, the nurse's attitude was completely inappropriate. He said to me: ""Oh madam, stop acting like this, come on!"" These words were unbearably cruel, especially at a time when I felt particularly vulnerable.

A hospital should be a place of listening, humanity, and compassionate care. Unfortunately, what I experienced here was the complete opposite. Blatant disregard for patients, an alarming lack of professionalism, and a total lack of empathy.

I strongly advise against this establishment to anyone, as it shows neither respect for patients nor their dignity. A disgrace for a place that is supposed to care for and protect.

Today was a good example of this:

After 6 weeks in a cast, it would be removed tomorrow at the orthopedics department, unfortunately I took a positive corona test yesterday. That's why I decided to call to ask if I'm still welcome (with a face mask).

The woman I spoke to on the phone did not know the procedure so she asked the doctor about it. I am then told that I would only be welcome 7 days after the infection. (so far no problem).

I responded that my symptoms started last week and that it has already been 7 days. Halfway through my sentence I got a very blunt answer; ""Then I might as well not have asked, sir, I won't let you come tomorrow."" In other words, thanks to Madam's childish thinking, my appointment is being rescheduled.

Of course it is frustrating that this will mean I will be in a cast for longer, but this is understandable. What I find especially unacceptable is not allowing the patient to speak out and responding bluntly/rudely. There is no friendly service. Nor from logical reasoning.

This is of course just one example, unfortunately the negative experiences in Uz Brussels are adding up faster than the positive ones these days.","Ó£ú","Ó†ç","Share","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (Dutch)","Like","3"

I complained of back pain that radiated down my leg, they could see that I was dragging my leg, that the pain was intense when I stood up or sat down, they talked to me about an appendix (which I had already removed), but since the child who examined me only had this protocol in mind, he didn't want to deviate from it to look for real causes related to my pain, he convinced me that I had a second appendicitis (üòÖyes, you read that right) and that I would have to be operated on.

The appointments with the doctors went very well, nothing to say about that. However, following a first appointment, she was on the waiting list for almost a year for a laser treatment of 8 medical sessions. She was given 2 appointments 1 month apart and since then nothing. She is again on the waiting list, without any certainty about the possibility of continuing the treatment she started, which was nevertheless working well. You should know that a session costs almost ‚Ç¨600. We contacted the billing department who did not want to hear anything; as well as the mediation department, which was otherwise very understanding. I had mentioned to them that I would pay if I got the appointments for the follow-up, and they found her two appointments on the same day this summer (one at 11 a.m. and one at 4 p.m.; convenient!), even though the dermatologist had stipulated not to do laser treatment during the summer. But again, it was a single appointment with no certainty about the continuation of the treatment. They purposely found an impossible appointment so that I would pay this bill. So it's done, I kept my word, but the appointments were immediately canceled. In the meantime, I received a reminder of the debt.
The contempt with which patients are treated therefore forces my daughter to not continue treatment at this hospital. We are therefore left with a very bitter taste in our mouths for having paid ‚Ç¨1,200 for two sessions out of a total of eight, for an incomplete and disrespectful service to the young woman who had been eagerly awaiting this treatment for over a year. So I don't recommend it at all; or at least, for those who have no choice, ask to have all the appointments for the complete treatment in advance. For us, in any case, it will never be there again, we have wasted enough time and money, to finally have to start the treatment again elsewhere...

I am a regular patient at the UZB and satisfied with most doctors, but I cannot recommend this doctor. When leaving the practice I did receive a response of ""sorry for the wait"" with his back turned to me, a little respect and politeness would have been the least.
Since this doctor seemed so uninterested, I am obliged to make a new appointment with another doctor, of course.","Ó£ú","Ó†ç","Share","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (Dutch)","Like","2"

I go to the emergency room with my 9 month old son and explain that he has had a fever of 40 for more than 10 days despite the interval of ibuprofen and dafalgan, he is completely amorphous, no longer feeds and no longer drinks.
A cough like no other and so on.
They made me wait 2 hours by putting a small ‚Äúsymptoms not serious‚Äù bracelet on him.
After 2 hours of waiting I was finally received to just listen to his heart, take his temperature without even taking a blood test and tell me ""don't worry it's viral it will pass."" Despite the fact that I insisted on further testing, they didn't want to hear anything.
The next day, after a night that was still just as disastrous, we decided to go to another hospital. He was immediately taken care of, blood taken (very complicated because of his dehydration which the pediatrician at the UZ had not even noticed...), stool tests, chest scan. Diagnosis: PNEUMONIA!!
Hospitalized for several days on antibiotics.
If I had listened to these ‚Äúdoctors‚Äù I would have lost my child. Scandalous to blame parents who insist as if we don't know our children.

I had 2 pages of listed examinations and consultations and 1 was charged in small letters 'nt. Complied with'. I had no appointment on that date, it is not in the timeline of the MyUz app, and no emails found, when you call billing it is almost immediately 'Yes, they will try to charge for that, will adjust', apparently a known problem, but not normal. It is more expensive than attending a consultation, mind you.

January 2024: The services are unreachable even if you call for 20 minutes. They keep saying that you better make the appointment via 'My Uz Brussels' but you don't have all the services in the bar there. You also keep getting told that they can call you back and then you have to press 1, but when you press 1 the waiting music stops and nothing else happens, never called back.

Suddenly emails with new appointments without asking if this is ok or if the patient can, unilaterally recorded, a month later when the treating physician considers it urgent.

A study that I have to perform: Next free date June 2024 when I went to inquire after another study mid-January. In yet another study requested by the specialist, a machine is defective and it is suspected that it will be within 3 months (then transfer to another hospital in case of defect instead of waiting lists). In the meantime, all symptoms are deteriorating. The GP is not happy about it.","Ó£ú","Ó†ç","Share","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (Dutch)","Like","4"

Excuse me? If a doctor or specialist prescribes a CT or MRI, will there be a reason for this, then do it 2 months later? We had to go somewhere else and the scan did indeed indicate things that absolutely could not wait. If I had left it at their pace, I would probably have perforated parts in my abdomen.

Hospital to avoid...

If unfortunately you are French-speaking and you do not know how to speak Dutch correctly, you are in trouble!

The reception is extremely unpleasant.

The caregivers sometimes it's okay, sometimes they consider you like objects.

My father was there for his lung cancer, my family fought for him to leave this hospital.
Lots of communication problems!

I also have a friend who experienced a rather unpleasant situation faced with the nastiness of the nurses.

Recently, November 23, 2023 my sister cannot leave the parking lot despite paying her parking ticket (still has the proof), she presses the doorbell and explains the situation ""in French"", the person on the intercom answers her quite simply that you have to speak in English or Dutch.

I would like to point out that this hospital is located in BRUSSELS in JETTE! and that we are PATIENT!

Working in a hospital environment is not the easiest job but I still think that this hospital has a lot of progress to make at all levels!

Seeing hospital staff and patients in pajamas smoking upon arrival completely contradicts awareness campaigns to quit smoking.

We just saw a receptionist being unprofessional by telling repeatedly to a guy that he took a ticket from someone else. We were all shocked by the way she accused him of something that no one in the hall understood! Why someone will take a ticket of someone else? There is no point! She was really rude, striking on her desk and instead of trying to understad why the machine didn't work she came back by telling him you have to wait longer with a new ticket! Not even apologizing for him! How this kind of people can be happy working as a receptionist! she should be instead in the army but certainly not welcomimg people in a hospital! What a shame for the image of the hospital! A colleague of her came back later saying there was indeed a mistake made by the machine ticket but even after this she didn't even dare try to come to apologize about her rude behavior to him! Really a bad image of her was seen by everyone but she didn't even see it and thinking what she done was correct while it was terrifying for everyone in the hall. We of course confort the guy and told him to not waste his time with this kind of toxic people. Unfortunately the management should do the minimum by having receptionist knowing how to behave and how to manage their emotions. They should know that they are in front of people who can be sick physically  (it's a hospital! This should be obvious!) and then requiring having a professionnel standard in the way to talk with patient. No one has the right to accuse someone without any prove everything else is just hatress and a really low level of professionalism as simple than that! They were a legal expert amomg us in the hall who later talk to him and who can help him to file a lawsuit as what he saw was not acceptable! Hope the best for him!

I went to the emergency room, and everything went well, following repeated examinations, they decided to keep me there, to be seen the next day by a surgeon.
The next day, everything went as planned, some of the problems were resolved, several people came to see me and intervene throughout the day, perfect! We finally decided to extend my stay and reserve the bed again to carry out a surgical procedure the following day.
The administration begins, that's done, I make my arrangements for work and for the family and I am asked to prepare to change the room.
Except that, a little while later, instead of changing the room I was told that, finally, the plan had been changed, tomorrow's intervention canceled, and that I was being let go home, with a planned treatment and a later and different intervention, after the crisis had passed.
At around 6:00 p.m., and I left the hospital like a brave man, proud of my clearly visible physical suffering, taking the üöä, since I had already announced my loved ones for my on-site schedule!
It's 2:30 a.m., at night, I haven't slept yet, in the morning I have to go to the hospital again to submit the papers that the administration had given me to complete, to pay the deposit for the room, but which, in the meantime, the counters have closed. helaas!!

My employer did not give me the opportunity to travel for the appointment.
So I called to reschedule the appointment (urgent, recommended by the doctor).
I dealt with a certain Nicolas in mammography who told me that since it was like that, I would have an appointment at the end of February, in 6 months.
I told him it wasn't possible to wait 6 months,
He showed ill will, even sadism, by declaring that things were not going as I wanted and that if I did not come tomorrow, it would be the end of February, ignoring the explanations I gave him concerning my employer and my concern due to my problem.
He didn't want to let go, until I told him that I would talk to the doctor about it, then he changed his mind and told me who was going to talk about it himself.
5 minutes later I had another appointment for in a few days.
I then had to deal with the secretary of the doctor in question, in oncology, a disaster.
Worse still, mean, condescending, cynical, impatient.
How can we be so harsh, inhumane, and mistreat people who are already suffering?
Change jobs, ladies and gentlemen, rather than mistreating patients.
I wish you with all my heart to be sick and to be treated as you treat us...
Contempt, malice, what a shame!

P.S:
Thank you all the same to the whole senology team who are extraordinary, very kind ladies, very human, full of empathy, and to the senology doctor who may recognize himself and whom I found really great üëå.

I want to share with you my experience today at UZ Hospital in the emergency department.
Despite the fact that it is my favorite hospital where I and my whole family were born and where we are monitored for everything.
Today, I faced a seemingly new nurse who pushed me when I was feeling unwell and who pushed my mother to separate her from me even though she had the right to accompany me with her accompanying bracelet (and held me because I was bending over to get up while constantly saying that I am 24 years old and that I am an adult). My mother did not want to intervene despite her bracelet to prevent me from getting angry and feeling unwell. The nurse violently pushed her and ripped off the cart then told me to take off my jacket while I was feeling unwell (my head fell down, the nurse pushed my forehead back with her finger) when I told her I can't she called me a child. My mother wanted to help me but she wouldn't let her (for what reason?).
I add to that that when she poked me for the blood test, she told me ‚Äúyou have HORRIBLE veins‚Äù as if I wasn‚Äôt stressed enough.
In short, a lamentable experience and I want you to take my complaint seriously and to believe in our humiliation that we experienced this morning. given that at that precise moment I did not know how to defend myself verbally or physically.
Yours truly.","Ó£ú","Ó†ç","Share","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (French)","Like","13"

I waited 2-3 minutes before seeing an emergency doctor. Given what I show him, he classifies me as a RED emergency and calls the service that should take care of me and gives me painkiller. He directs me to a waiting room, to wait for the person who will take me to the department. It is 11:45 a.m. and I am in the waiting room of the gynecology department.  And there, the doctor who agreed to see me (I remind you that it was an emergency classified RED!) took the liberty of telling me that she was going to see ALL her patients before seeing me. Result: a cyst the size of a golf ball, an incision WITHOUT ANESTHESIA, no painkillers prescribed and a break of more than a week. I'm supposed to go back on Wednesday for a check-up.....

When we go to complain to the nurses about the intensity of the symptoms over time, we find by chance a single nurse who also complains that there are a lot of patients.... So, this hospital shows that it is incapable of managing patients in the emergency room.

When waiting in the emergency room you get the impression that it is a caf√© UZ. There are a bunch of employees there who do not ask themselves how their patients are doing. You ring the bell and you wait there every time for 30 minutes to 1 hour before someone arrives, only to be told that they have to inform themselves and to come back another hour later. The only way to get information is to call our GP, so that she can contact the expert person at UZ Jette again. Comments that go down a bit the wrong way when we ask for an examination: ""we will check whether there is nothing life-threatening, you can do the rest with the GP"". It is logical to do as many examinations as possible. We are people and not numbers. There was only one doctor who helped us.

Don't go there. 4 inseminations + 1 IVF = 0 babies. Let's admit it's bad luck. Support, supposedly by a doctor who is treating us personally, no luck again, when I call the center I'm told he'll be away for several weeks. Appointment for IVF, they make you sign an impressive amount of paperwork to tell you, what do we do if there are too many embryos.......etc, but at no time do they tell you what do we do if we can't reimplant. And yes, I paid the puncture + reimplantation package. No luck again, despite 7 follicles punctured, 0 reimplantations. Moreover, they don't know how to do their sums. We paid every time we went there. They send invoices that have already been paid. I called them to explain their mistake, they admitted the error. And I received a debt collection letter from another organization. What's certain is that when we're at the reception desk to pay, they're very friendly, helpful, and kind. However, on the IVF table, we're like useless pieces of meat.
In short, I STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST IT. I advise you to move on and go to Chirec Hospital instead.

I gave birth there during a rush (about thirty deliveries that night), and yet the staff was incredibly caring; it was a wonderful experience.
If I need to make appointments, whether for pediatrics or other matters, I make them there.
I've never received any comments or unwanted looks even though I wear a headscarf (which should be normal too üòÇ).

I am coming to you regarding a call I made this morning dated 06/7/2021 at 8:03. I first had a very friendly lady at the central reception who redirected me to the pediatric department. And then to my great astonishment, I didn't even have time to place one, when the lady from the secretariat spoke to me in an aggressive manner and told me that her job is secretary and that she is not a doctor. I ask her why this meanness towards me and she hangs up on me. While I was just asking about my daughter, who is drinking a lot of water these days and going to the bathroom a lot, maybe type 1 diabetes. I don't know which department I should go to. She told me again I am not a doctor, you want an appointment with a doctor which she repeats to me.

Unbelievable, I called St Luc hospital who directly redirected me to the emergency room and advised me to bring my daughter urgently.

I'm on my way to pick her up from school.

But this lady's attitude is unacceptable.

Yours sincerely","Ó£ú","Ó†ç","Share","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (French)","Like","7"

I will report to the reception on Wednesday. Closed.  I had to be somewhere else.
2 I had requested a single room long in advance.  Not received.

Coronography and cardiac angioplasty (insertion of two stents) in mid-October...
The first surgery didn't produce the same results in the operating room as the CT scan and resulted in a stay of operation, followed by a second surgery 15 days later.
Following this surgery, I had to take mandatory medication to thin the blood and regulate my blood pressure.
After taking an initial blood pressure medication that caused significant side effects, the cardiologist (Doctor Soens) prescribed an equivalent medication that unfortunately caused even more side effects, including irregular heartbeat, chest pain, dizziness, etc.

A post-operative appointment was scheduled for November 9th, but was ultimately canceled by the UZ. So I sent an email to the cardiologist with a reminder the next day and a request to forward my email to the cardiology secretary on the third and fourth days to inform them of my poor and worrying condition. WITHOUT ANY REACTION!

This cardiologist, who is supposed to monitor you pre- and post-op, finally allowed herself to contact me via WhatsApp after four days (because she doesn't answer the phone or emails) and wrote to me today:

""For me, everything has been answered. You can't tolerate the first medication, so you're stopping it and are now taking the second! ...
Was there another question?""

THE POST-OPERATIVE FOLLOW-UP FROM THIS CARDIOLOGIST IS INCREDIBLE, both in form and tone!

UNTOLERABLE for such a hospital (cardiology) department!

The choice of a private cardiologist is a natural one!","Ó£ú","Ó†ç","Share","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (French)","Like","5"

It was 11 p.m. and she was finally taken care of at 3:15 a.m. by a young intern who asked a completely wrong diagnosis.

After explaining to him that she had had a small injury near her wrist a week earlier, the arm had become very painful since the beginning of the evening. (We are dealing with a problem of lymphedema of the lower limbs, which my partner made clear to him).

I suspected at least superficial phlebitis and he simply concluded that it was absolutely nothing and that a few dafalgans would be enough to resolve the problem.

Faced with this more than doubtful diagnosis and the increase in pain, she went to see her doctor today. He directly found the reason for the condition: lymphangitis.
The emergency blood test revealed a bacterial streptococcal infection which had entered lymphedema through the wound.
Fortunately the infection has not yet passed into the circulatory system, which could have led to sepsis.

I am outraged by the thoughtlessness and incompetence of this young intern who takes pleasure in his certainties as a medical doctor, which seems to give him the right to treat his patient like a mythomaniac and to absolutely ignore symptoms and insistences which led her to come for the first time in her life to the emergency room for treatment.

Too bad zero rating is not possible

A huge thank you to the general practitioner for the relevance, foresight, and listening which allowed him to directly make the right diagnosis.","Ó£ú","Ó†ç","Share","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (French)","Like","10"

Clean places certainly BUT quality of care, deplorable, in the emergency room first of all an excessively long waiting time even though it was only 8 a.m., weekday!, after more than an hour of wasted waiting, you are received by a student!!! I tell her that it's a doctor I want to see, SHE ANSWERS ME THIS IS THE USUAL PROCEDURE, AFTER THE DOCTOR WILL COME,...!!! I had to let myself be examined by the student and after another 50 minutes of waiting by ANOTHER YOUNG WHO WAS CALLED A DOCTOR!!! I had the impression that she didn't even understand French because she was re-formulating the same questions to me!!

It's cold and snowing today!!!!!!!!!

Today my dad can leave this hospital after a week stay. The social worker (her name is ELS) ordered a taxi for my dad that will arrive at the hospital between 13 and 15 o'clock to pick him up. We arrived at the hospital around 13 o'clock and the nurses told us that my dad left 20 min ago (12h40)????!!!!

We called the social worker to inform why my dad left 20 min earlier than expected and agreed. She wasn't aware so she called the taximan and tells us that the taximan will wait.

Soon later i received a call from an unknown number with my dad's voice telling us the taximan just left. he was alone in front of the door!!!

So i called the social worker again that this is not acceptable. She told me she can't do anything and she assumed that we are home to welcome him. Let's make this more clear.
She finds it logic that when someone ordered a taxi for a patient to leave the hospital that the family will be home!!!!!!!!
She never asked us about this!!!!!
She told us this and said she can't do anything. Sorry but there are plenty of ways to help this.
e.g. by calling the driver again and tell him to stay or or or....
She seemed not to be aware that leaving a patient who can't move in front of a door is NOT OK!! especially with the weather condition of today!!!

Luckily a neighbour saw my dad there alone and watched over him. I didn't know my neighbourhood. We are new people arriving there in the area.

After a couple of calls with the social worker i suggested that it's better not to assume (without asking) that the family will be home to pick up the patient. Instead of being sorry for it she told me: it's better not to order a taxi the same day of leaving the hospital... WHAT?!!

I'm really disappointed in the service and the irresponsibility that this social worker Els provided/showed us and

IT'S NOT OK TO:
1 ordered a taxi but not being aware that the taxi came earlier
2 letting the patient (who can't move ) leaving the hospital with a taxi man without any confirmation of the family
3 for assuming that the family will be home
4 Leaving a patient who can't move alone at the destination
5 not even sorry about the situation and putting the responsibility away

I will NEVER order a transport with this service of this hospital. It's pitty that such a good hospital with excellent medical care and doctors has such a irresponsible social worker.

I know that probably the service of complaint won't even read my complain.

But I sincerely hope nobody's dad, mom or children will ever be in this situation. Especially in the medical world where responsibilities have such a big impact. Medical care people are really trained by themselves to pass/shift the responsibilities or making excuses that it's not their fault.","Ó£ú","Ó†ç","Share","","","","Like","16"

Dutch-speaking and they also speak French and English with a smile, in that area no other hospital in Brussels can compete with the UZ. Given the size of the hospital, it is of course difficult to generalize, but according to my own experiences: high quality of care (with a number of services that are among the European or even world top), friendly and competent staff, neatly renovated rooms with all the necessities, large and efficient emergency service (at least if you come with something that indeed requires some urgency), free WiFi both during consultation and admission, and so on. The disadvantage is that the billing service is rather slow and cumbersome, although this may apply to more hospitals and they are taking cautious steps towards digitalization. Another small disadvantage: no air conditioning in the rooms, so hospitalization at very hot times is not recommended.","Ó£ú","Ó†ç","Share","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (Dutch)","Like","4"

I am followed privately by en gin who works in this hospital. I went to the emergency room with strong contractions and pain in week 42, heavy ones, baby who had no more amniotic fluid for a few days, at 11 p.m. at night, the induced birth which was planned 16 hours later.....after spending 5 hours in the emergency room I returned home with contractions which reached up to 70% every 2/3 minutes, I even knew it didn't work but I have to wait until tomorrow for the appointment because after them I am not in work.

So I have chronic generalized epilepsy. I came by ambulance so I didn't ask for anything. I had a seizure at home. They tell me a shot of valium and you get out because I need to make the bed!!!!!!","Ó£ú","Ó†ç","Share","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (French)","Like","9"
