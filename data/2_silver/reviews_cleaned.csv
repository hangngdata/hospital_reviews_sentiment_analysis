m555,2025,English,"I had an ivf consultation with a female Prof. and felt that a conclusion and diagnosis was reached already within 5 mins only by verbal information ƒ± could transfer in that limited time and initial conclusion dominated the whole session. Our test results/documents were not reviewed throughout the session, no physical examination was made. given the complexity of fertility treatments and different approaches different clinics and doctors are following internationally, ƒ± felt the consultation came out too definitive, lack of comparative approach, medical curiosity and individualised perspective. I also felt the manner of conveying information was quite insensitive. I feel ƒ± couldn‚Äôt have any nuanced discussion on my input/questions. I found there was not much room to discuss based on previous medical advice from other doctors as well, as the conclusion seemed not to be challenged. Disappointed, wouldn‚Äôt go back. Having spoken to different consultants, I haven't encountered a similar lack of empathy in a medical setting.

LC,2025,French,"I went to UZ Brussel in 2020 for egg cryopreservation and in 2025 for IVF, and I do not recommend this facility. If I had had the choice, I would not have gone back this year. The follow-up is drastically lacking in humanity.

A question asked, a request for information, even a very simple one, results in a phone appointment and a bill. I was well aware that this was a business, but this is disgusting. My file was very poorly managed. Two days before the transfer, the lab was supposed to call me to confirm the transfer. No one called. I called several times without a response. In such a process, it is unacceptable to leave women in total disarray. 15 days later, I am not pregnant. A woman called me to say, ""Bad news! You're not pregnant! Would you like to reschedule?"" I told her I was waiting to hear about the other embryos so I could see if another appointment was necessary. To which she replied, ""You'll receive a letter. I'll let you call us back to reschedule. Have a great day!""

I received a one-line letter two weeks later and no medical report announcing the destruction of all the remaining embryos. It's a bit of a long wait when they can simply tell me over the phone. I guess they don't want to be burdened with the patients' feelings. I had to follow up every other day for a month to get an explanation and an apology, and I just received a new bill for the doctor's apologetic call.

I don't question the doctors' competence, but both of my experiences were extremely violent on a human level.

If my story can help other women avoid going through a similar experience, it will at least have helped in some way.",UZ Brussel

The staff is very pleasant and professional. We will definitely return to this hospital if we have any problems. The only downside is that the staff did not notify us when they put my son in ""quarantine,"" so we opened the door to air out the room, and the nurse was not happy.

Divine Nkasia,2025,French,"[EN] Bad experience at the UZ Brussels Emergency Room

On May 27th, around noon, I went to the UZ Brussels Emergency Room due to very intense intestinal pain, to the point where I could barely walk. The situation was extremely difficult, both physically and emotionally.

After the administrative formalities, I was treated by a young man who showed no professionalism. I, as the patient, had to ""guide"" him, which was completely unacceptable. He then disappeared without explanation, leaving me alone for 50 minutes in an examination room, without any communication or follow-up.

I could hear the emergency room doctors talking in the hallway while I stood there, helpless. I finally spoke to them myself to let them know I had been there for an hour. It was only then that an emergency room doctor came in and concluded, without any real examination, that I ""wasn't sick."" No blood test was performed, even though this is a fundamental basic examination in this type of situation. I wasted nearly four hours for nothing.

I finally went to another hospital, Brugmann Hospital, where I immediately had a blood test, a urine test, and an X-ray. It turned out that my intestines were obstructed and my blood showed a clearly elevated inflammatory level. UZ Brussels completely abandoned me. They didn't even provide basic medical care; a simple blood test, which is essential in emergencies, wasn't even performed.

Poor communication, a lack of professionalism, and a passive attitude seem to be the norm there. An emergency department like the one at UZ Brussels should be ashamed of providing such deplorable care. No concrete action has been taken. I was literally told that ""if we had to take a blood test from everyone, it wouldn't be feasible"" and that I ""didn't look sick."" Who are you to judge a person's health based solely on their appearance? If I come to the emergency room, it's for a serious reason.

The staff, or rather the students who circulate there, seemed extremely incompetent to me. I will never set foot in your chaotic emergency department again. Urgently reconsider your priorities.",UZ Brussel
Bullet,2025,Dutch,"One star is too many. Our 8-year-old son had an appointment for his circumcision at 12:00 noon. Because the procedure is performed under general anesthesia, he was not allowed to eat anything from 7:00 in the morning and drink until 11:30 (with only a little until 10:00, to be safe). He did not go into the operating room for the anesthesia until 17:00. It unnecessarily made our child suffer for five more hours without food and drink, which is unacceptable.

Why make an appointment at 12:00, if he has to wait so long? We were finally allowed to go home around 22:00, without a pediatrician to advise us or a certificate of absence from school. We were not given help to get to the exit and had to climb the stairs with a fresh wound on his genitals ‚Äî which is downright barbaric.

The nurse advised us to go to the emergency room to get a certificate for school and to get additional information about the treatment. After the hurdles of getting there, we were told that I had to register again for a consultation in the emergency room, which would mean another two hours of waiting. I explained that we had been in the hospital since 11:30, that my son still had a wound and that the staff was not doing anything about it. They laughed at us and refused to call a pediatrician for us alone.

Exhausted, irritated and with my son just out of anesthesia, we left for home without any help. This was especially frustrating because our vehicle was at the pediatric ward, where we had to register. On the street, on foot, because all other exits were closed after 22:00, we had to walk to our vehicle with a bloody wound in the genitals ‚Äî an absurd situation.

You would expect a university hospital to function at a professional level, especially in terms of organization. Instead, blunder after blunder is made. This is not the first time I have had such experiences, but because my son has been so badly affected, I feel compelled to share my story.

If you think another hospital is better, chances are you will be more satisfied there.",UZ Brussel

Robert bral,2025,Dutch,"UZ Brussel in Jette is the worst hospital there is.
1 star is still too much.
I went for a day admission. The nurse makes you sign a paper that you agree to the operation just before you are taken to the operating room (you are already lying in a hospital bed). Why can't you do that in advance?
You don't get to see or speak to a doctor, not before the operation. And even less so after the operation. Not a word in the operating room either.
You are just a number.
I asked for a light anaesthetic. But the result was that I was anaesthetised for almost 4 hours, for a 40-minute procedure. I probably got an overdose of propofol. It was 6 pm when I woke up. At that moment, of course, there was no more doctor to be seen. The nurse threw me out of the recovery room as quickly as possible. This is totally irresponsible for a patient who has just woken up from anaesthesia. I only heard from the doctor after 3 days and that was after I had filed a complaint with the ombudsman because I felt that my rights as a patient had been violated.
Due to the heavy anesthesia that they gave me without asking, I now have memory loss.

Romane Habran,2025,French,"After two visits to the emergency departments of two other hospitals, the UZ emergencies (finally) took care of me!

Huge ear infection (see photos: D1 and D5 - hospital discharge) following a new piercing, and already on antibiotics for 6 days, with no improvement, quite the contrary!

I was directly in contact with an ENT who decided to make an incision to remove the infection which had been stored for days (a good week)! - Medical procedure already requested 3 days earlier in another hospital which refused it to me because supposedly ‚Äúwe never make an incision or puncture in an ear‚Äù! -

Unfortunately for me, the infection had already gone down into the blood so I had to be hospitalized. I had the opportunity to see the ENT in question every morning of my hospitalization, with clear follow-up (the doctor knows the situation), without passing through the hands of various ENTs.

The nurses were gentle and attentive, always worried about whether I had everything I needed. The ENT was always very clear in his explanations and medical actions towards me.

The food was good, the shower water hot, the room cleaned daily, the bed made again every morning, etc.

The decision was always made in my presence: the explanation of why I was kept for another day, and on the day of my release, the ENT was very attentive to my desire to leave, and given the improvement in my situation, accepted my release. I found it very appreciable!

Living in the Li√®ge region, UZ is far from home, but if I had to go back there, I would without hesitation.

Little advice: the doctor should also look at the end of the day at the results of the various examinations carried out during the day (blood test, smears, etc.) to put in place the ad hoc solution to the health problem as quickly as possible (e.g. targeted bacteria - appropriate antibiotic requested - first dose by the patient in the evening and not just the next afternoon).",UZ Brussel

Armaghan Azhar,2025,French,"I arrived at UZ Brussels at 2 p.m. with urgent complaints, and all I was given was paracetamol. At 6 p.m., I still had not received any clear information on the planned treatment. Throughout this time, I suffered from significant pain, without adequate care.

The nursing staff were unprofessional and unempathetic. When I asked for help, I felt like I was bothering me, like they were doing me a favor rather than fulfilling their mission. They stayed in their room talking among themselves, while the patients waited, suffering in uncertainty. It is obvious that efficiency and attention to patient needs are not their priority.

I hope no one has to find themselves in a similar situation. Medical care should be based on seriousness, responsiveness and respect for patients, principles which, unfortunately, are sorely lacking here. A deplorable experience!!!",UZ Brussel

Serhat,2025,French,"I have just seen that my opinion which I had written at the time of the events had not been published (downright censored)
I am writing again to express my deep concern and dissatisfaction regarding the treatment my mother received during her stay in the geriatrics department of your establishment. She was admitted there because of a broken hip and a collapsed vertebra, leaving her almost unable to walk.

Unfortunately, we were confronted with behavior that I consider unacceptable from some nurses. My mother, who already has difficulty expressing herself in French, was systematically addressed in Dutch, although the staff spoke French perfectly. This created an unnecessary and unfair communication barrier.

Additionally, I have witnessed behavior that I would describe as abuse. My mother was pushed in the back with a clenched fist, forcing me to intervene and warn the staff that I would not hesitate to contact the appropriate authorities if such acts happened again. Furthermore, his cell phone was hidden, preventing him from contacting me to report these incidents.

These experiences shocked me deeply. I would like to emphasize that I am not generalizing about all staff, but the actions of certain team members have seriously damaged our confidence in your establishment. A nurse's use of the term ""Dutch-speaking factory"" to describe the hospital was also particularly disturbing.

I ask you to take these concerns and the many opinions of all these people who have commented on their experiences in this hospital seriously and to conduct a thorough investigation into these incidents. It is essential that every patient, regardless of language or origin, is treated with dignity and respect. I am convinced that corrective measures are necessary to ensure that such situations do not recur.",UZ Brussel

G√ºldeniz Asker,2025,French,"I went to the emergency room by ambulance. After 7 hours of waiting I didn't get my blood+urine test results and I didn't see the doctor either.
The nurses kept saying you can go home if you want, and ask your GP for your results.
I come home with intense pain. The next day I contacted the hospital to ask to send me the results so that I could go to a doctor on call (because my doctor does not work on weekends). Very unpleasant on the phone telling me that they cannot transfer my results to me and that in any case it was nothing serious.
I went to an on-call doctor who sent me to the hospital in Asse.
I am taken care of immediately upon my arrival at the Asse hospital.
I was transferred to Aalst for an appendicitis operation.
A few hours later I had surgery.

The emergency nurse responded to me in a condescending tone: ""Come on, madam, get up, you can do it yourself."" There was no gesture of help or even consideration.

Later, during a blood test, I fainted. Here again, the nurse's attitude was completely inappropriate. He said to me: ""Oh madam, stop acting like this, come on!"" These words were unbearably cruel, especially at a time when I felt particularly vulnerable.

A hospital should be a place of listening, humanity, and compassionate care. Unfortunately, what I experienced here was the complete opposite. Blatant disregard for patients, an alarming lack of professionalism, and a total lack of empathy.

I strongly advise against this establishment to anyone, as it shows neither respect for patients nor their dignity. A disgrace for a place that is supposed to care for and protect.

Today was a good example of this:

After 6 weeks in a cast, it would be removed tomorrow at the orthopedics department, unfortunately I took a positive corona test yesterday. That's why I decided to call to ask if I'm still welcome (with a face mask).

The woman I spoke to on the phone did not know the procedure so she asked the doctor about it. I am then told that I would only be welcome 7 days after the infection. (so far no problem).

I responded that my symptoms started last week and that it has already been 7 days. Halfway through my sentence I got a very blunt answer; ""Then I might as well not have asked, sir, I won't let you come tomorrow."" In other words, thanks to Madam's childish thinking, my appointment is being rescheduled.

Of course it is frustrating that this will mean I will be in a cast for longer, but this is understandable. What I find especially unacceptable is not allowing the patient to speak out and responding bluntly/rudely. There is no friendly service. Nor from logical reasoning.

But again, it was a single appointment with no certainty about the continuation of the treatment. They purposely found an impossible appointment so that I would pay this bill. So it's done, I kept my word, but the appointments were immediately canceled. In the meantime, I received a reminder of the debt.
The contempt with which patients are treated therefore forces my daughter to not continue treatment at this hospital. We are therefore left with a very bitter taste in our mouths for having paid ‚Ç¨1,200 for two sessions out of a total of eight, for an incomplete and disrespectful service to the young woman who had been eagerly awaiting this treatment for over a year. So I don't recommend it at all; or at least, for those who have no choice, ask to have all the appointments for the complete treatment in advance. For us, in any case, it will never be there again, we have wasted enough time and money, to finally have to start the treatment again elsewhere... Total lack of respect!",UZ Brussel

The midwifes and doctors at Maternity unit and Delivery are just angels - they all speak English, were very supportive and have tons and tons of knowledge to address any issues. I love the approach of the hospital to promote natural birth and avoid interventions. And even though my labour went completely opposite to the plan and I ended up to need a labour induction, epidural and C-section in the end (since I went overdue and my naturally initiated labour did not progress well) I am absolutely happy with all the choices made by the doctors and have no doubts they made all they could to avoid unnecessary procedures, just as I wished.

The next day, after a night that was still just as disastrous, we decided to go to another hospital. He was immediately taken care of, blood taken (very complicated because of his dehydration which the pediatrician at the UZ had not even noticed...), stool tests, chest scan. Diagnosis: PNEUMONIA!!

It is more expensive than attending a consultation, mind you.

January 2024: The services are unreachable even if you call for 20 minutes. They keep saying that you better make the appointment via 'My Uz Brussels' but you don't have all the services in the bar there. You also keep getting told that they can call you back and then you have to press 1, but when you press 1 the waiting music stops and nothing else happens, never called back.

Suddenly emails with new appointments without asking if this is ok or if the patient can, unilaterally recorded, a month later when the treating physician considers it urgent.

Hospital to avoid...

If unfortunately you are French-speaking and you do not know how to speak Dutch correctly, you are in trouble!

The reception is extremely unpleasant.

The caregivers sometimes it's okay, sometimes they consider you like objects.

My father was there for his lung cancer, my family fought for him to leave this hospital.
Lots of communication problems!

I also have a friend who experienced a rather unpleasant situation faced with the nastiness of the nurses.

Recently, November 23, 2023 my sister cannot leave the parking lot despite paying her parking ticket (still has the proof), she presses the doorbell and explains the situation ""in French"", the person on the intercom answers her quite simply that you have to speak in English or Dutch.

I would like to point out that this hospital is located in BRUSSELS in JETTE! and that we are PATIENT!

Working in a hospital environment is not the easiest job but I still think that this hospital has a lot of progress to make at all levels!

She was really rude, striking on her desk and instead of trying to understad why the machine didn't work she came back by telling him you have to wait longer with a new ticket! Not even apologizing for him! How this kind of people can be happy working as a receptionist! she should be instead in the army but certainly not welcomimg people in a hospital! What a shame for the image of the hospital! A colleague of her came back later saying there was indeed a mistake made by the machine ticket but even after this she didn't even dare try to come to apologize about her rude behavior to him! Really a bad image of her was seen by everyone but she didn't even see it and thinking what she done was correct while it was terrifying for everyone in the hall. We of course confort the guy and told him to not waste his time with this kind of toxic people. Unfortunately the management should do the minimum by having receptionist knowing how to behave and how to manage their emotions. They should know that they are in front of people who can be sick physically  (it's a hospital! This should be obvious!) and then requiring having a professionnel standard in the way to talk with patient. No one has the right to accuse someone without any prove everything else is just hatress and a really low level of professionalism as simple than that! They were a legal expert amomg us in the hall who later talk to him and who can help him to file a lawsuit as what he saw was not acceptable! Hope the best for him!

I went to the emergency room, and everything went well, following repeated examinations, they decided to keep me there, to be seen the next day by a surgeon.
The next day, everything went as planned, some of the problems were resolved, several people came to see me and intervene throughout the day, perfect! We finally decided to extend my stay and reserve the bed again to carry out a surgical procedure the following day.
The administration begins, that's done, I make my arrangements for work and for the family and I am asked to prepare to change the room.
Except that, a little while later, instead of changing the room I was told that, finally, the plan had been changed, tomorrow's intervention canceled, and that I was being let go home, with a planned treatment and a later and different intervention, after the crisis had passed.
At around 6:00 p.m., and I left the hospital like a brave man, proud of my clearly visible physical suffering, taking the üöä, since I had already announced my loved ones for my on-site schedule!

I told him it wasn't possible to wait 6 months,
He showed ill will, even sadism, by declaring that things were not going as I wanted and that if I did not come tomorrow, it would be the end of February, ignoring the explanations I gave him concerning my employer and my concern due to my problem.
He didn't want to let go, until I told him that I would talk to the doctor about it, then he changed his mind and told me who was going to talk about it himself.
5 minutes later I had another appointment for in a few days.
I then had to deal with the secretary of the doctor in question, in oncology, a disaster.
Worse still, mean, condescending, cynical, impatient.
How can we be so harsh, inhumane, and mistreat people who are already suffering?
Change jobs, ladies and gentlemen, rather than mistreating patients.

samia badaoui,2024,French,"Good morning,
I want to share with you my experience today at UZ Hospital in the emergency department.
Despite the fact that it is my favorite hospital where I and my whole family were born and where we are monitored for everything.
Today, I faced a seemingly new nurse who pushed me when I was feeling unwell and who pushed my mother to separate her from me even though she had the right to accompany me with her accompanying bracelet (and held me because I was bending over to get up while constantly saying that I am 24 years old and that I am an adult). My mother did not want to intervene despite her bracelet to prevent me from getting angry and feeling unwell. The nurse violently pushed her and ripped off the cart then told me to take off my jacket while I was feeling unwell (my head fell down, the nurse pushed my forehead back with her finger) when I told her I can't she called me a child. My mother wanted to help me but she wouldn't let her (for what reason?).
I add to that that when she poked me for the blood test, she told me ‚Äúyou have HORRIBLE veins‚Äù as if I wasn‚Äôt stressed enough.
In short, a lamentable experience and I want you to take my complaint seriously and to believe in our humiliation that we experienced this morning. given that at that precise moment I did not know how to defend myself verbally or physically.
Yours truly.",UZ Brussel

And there, the doctor who agreed to see me (I remind you that it was an emergency classified RED!) took the liberty of telling me that she was going to see ALL her patients before seeing me.

Appointment for IVF, they make you sign an impressive amount of paperwork to tell you, what do we do if there are too many embryos.......etc, but at no time do they tell you what do we do if we can't reimplant. And yes, I paid the puncture + reimplantation package. No luck again, despite 7 follicles punctured, 0 reimplantations. Moreover, they don't know how to do their sums. We paid every time we went there. They send invoices that have already been paid. I called them to explain their mistake, they admitted the error. And I received a debt collection letter from another organization. What's certain is that when we're at the reception desk to pay, they're very friendly, helpful, and kind. However, on the IVF table, we're like useless pieces of meat.
In short, I STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST IT. I advise you to move on and go to Chirec Hospital instead.

I am coming to you regarding a call I made this morning dated 06/7/2021 at 8:03. I first had a very friendly lady at the central reception who redirected me to the pediatric department. And then to my great astonishment, I didn't even have time to place one, when the lady from the secretariat spoke to me in an aggressive manner and told me that her job is secretary and that she is not a doctor. I ask her why this meanness towards me and she hangs up on me. While I was just asking about my daughter, who is drinking a lot of water these days and going to the bathroom a lot, maybe type 1 diabetes. I don't know which department I should go to.

SABATINO TERRACCIANO,2021,French,"What a scandalous post-operative follow-up...
Coronography and cardiac angioplasty (insertion of two stents) in mid-October...
The first surgery didn't produce the same results in the operating room as the CT scan and resulted in a stay of operation, followed by a second surgery 15 days later.
Following this surgery, I had to take mandatory medication to thin the blood and regulate my blood pressure.
After taking an initial blood pressure medication that caused significant side effects, the cardiologist (Doctor Soens) prescribed an equivalent medication that unfortunately caused even more side effects, including irregular heartbeat, chest pain, dizziness, etc.

A post-operative appointment was scheduled for November 9th, but was ultimately canceled by the UZ. So I sent an email to the cardiologist with a reminder the next day and a request to forward my email to the cardiology secretary on the third and fourth days to inform them of my poor and worrying condition. WITHOUT ANY REACTION!

This cardiologist, who is supposed to monitor you pre- and post-op, finally allowed herself to contact me via WhatsApp after four days (because she doesn't answer the phone or emails) and wrote to me today:

""For me, everything has been answered. You can't tolerate the first medication, so you're stopping it and are now taking the second! ...

After explaining to him that she had had a small injury near her wrist a week earlier, the arm had become very painful since the beginning of the evening. (We are dealing with a problem of lymphedema of the lower limbs, which my partner made clear to him).

I suspected at least superficial phlebitis and he simply concluded that it was absolutely nothing and that a few dafalgans would be enough to resolve the problem.

Faced with this more than doubtful diagnosis and the increase in pain, she went to see her doctor today. He directly found the reason for the condition: lymphangitis.
The emergency blood test revealed a bacterial streptococcal infection which had entered lymphedema through the wound.
Fortunately the infection has not yet passed into the circulatory system, which could have led to sepsis.

I am outraged by the thoughtlessness and incompetence of this young intern who takes pleasure in his certainties as a medical doctor, which seems to give him the right to treat his patient like a mythomaniac and to absolutely ignore symptoms and insistences which led her to come for the first time in her life to the emergency room for treatment.

I often hear people complain about the waiting time in hospitals, but people have to realize that a hospital is not a hotel where everything can go the way 'the customer' wants it. People try to do everything they can to follow their planning and to ensure that everything goes according to schedule, but for example, you cannot predict emergencies, which take priority over less urgent matters. You should be that serious emergency yourself. We shouldn't complain about the health care in this hospital, I haven't found anything better myself. I speak from personal experience.",UZ Brussel

Minus point for admission to a V.E. no explanation about bathroom/shower locations and where the water filter system is located.

Eva Xia,2019,English,"They left a patient (my dad) who can't move (arms and legs) in front of my door. It's cold and snowing today!!!!!!!!!

Today my dad can leave this hospital after a week stay. The social worker (her name is ELS) ordered a taxi for my dad that will arrive at the hospital between 13 and 15 o'clock to pick him up. We arrived at the hospital around 13 o'clock and the nurses told us that my dad left 20 min ago (12h40)????!!!!

We called the social worker to inform why my dad left 20 min earlier than expected and agreed. She wasn't aware so she called the taximan and tells us that the taximan will wait.

Soon later i received a call from an unknown number with my dad's voice telling us the taximan just left. he was alone in front of the door!!!

So i called the social worker again that this is not acceptable. She told me she can't do anything and she assumed that we are home to welcome him. Let's make this more clear.
She finds it logic that when someone ordered a taxi for a patient to leave the hospital that the family will be home!!!!!!!!
She never asked us about this!!!!!
She told us this and said she can't do anything. Sorry but there are plenty of ways to help this.
e.g. by calling the driver again and tell him to stay or or or....
She seemed not to be aware that leaving a patient who can't move in front of a door is NOT OK!! especially with the weather condition of today!!!

Luckily a neighbour saw my dad there alone and watched over him. I didn't know my neighbourhood. We are new people arriving there in the area.

After a couple of calls with the social worker i suggested that it's better not to assume (without asking) that the family will be home to pick up the patient. Instead of being sorry for it she told me: it's better not to order a taxi the same day of leaving the hospital... WHAT?!!

I'm really disappointed in the service and the irresponsibility that this social worker Els provided/showed us and

IT'S NOT OK TO:
1 ordered a taxi but not being aware that the taxi came earlier
2 letting the patient (who can't move ) leaving the hospital with a taxi man without any confirmation of the family
3 for assuming that the family will be home
4 Leaving a patient who can't move alone at the destination
5 not even sorry about the situation and putting the responsibility away

I will NEVER order a transport with this service of this hospital. It's pitty that such a good hospital with excellent medical care and doctors has such a irresponsible social worker.

I know that probably the service of complaint won't even read my complain.

But I sincerely hope nobody's dad, mom or children will ever be in this situation. Especially in the medical world where responsibilities have such a big impact. Medical care people are really trained by themselves to pass/shift the responsibilities or making excuses that it's not their fault.",UZ Brussel

Teddy cool,2025,English,"I am Very Disappointed with the Care at UZ Leuven Gasthuisberg ‚Äì Pediatric and ENT Departments

I am writing this review as a deeply concerned parent following a very disappointing and distressing experience at UZ Leuven Gasthuisberg.

On May 20th, 2025, we brought our 14-month-old son to the emergency department. After waiting for over an hour, we were seen by a pediatric ENT specialist, Dr. Julie Van Waterschoot. She attempted to examine my son‚Äôs ear but said she could not see the eardrum due to wax buildup. During the removal process, she caused significant bleeding in his left ear. She explained that it was only a scratch and that the eardrum was not damaged, but as a parent, it was extremely difficult to trust this explanation without clarity or reassurance.

Following this, we experienced further delays and were then informed that our son would undergo a blood test and a CT scan. We were very concerned about the necessity and safety of exposing a 14-month-old to such a procedure, yet we were given little time or information to make an informed decision.

Eventually, a decision was made to surgically insert tubes in both ears by cutting through the eardrums ‚Äî a step that seemed very sudden and aggressive, especially without clear communication or sufficient empathy from the staff. Throughout this experience, I found many of the doctors and nurses unapproachable, unsympathetic, and at times dismissive.

As a parent, you place an enormous amount of trust in a hospital‚Äôs staff when your child is in pain. Unfortunately, that trust was severely damaged by the way this situation was handled ‚Äî both medically and emotionally.

If you really care about your children health, PLEASE CONSIDER NOT TO BRING THEM TO UZ Leuven Gasthuisberg!!!!!!!!!!",UZ Leuven Gasthuisberg

On the other hand, very bad experience in the hepatology hospitalization department, most of the nurses are limited in their level of care and more particularly the nurse Mike, constantly under stress and because of this provides very poor care and the contact with the patient and family is Zero. He gave my dad pneumonia because of his nervousness, no dialogue with my dad, as if he was already dead, just telling him that he is very ill, as if he wanted to lower his morale.

Also, very bad experience with Dr. Laleman Wim, he is an inhuman and doubtful person. If you are sick, it is better not to have something too serious otherwise it will overwhelm them and they would rather see you die.
Also, the so-called speech therapist in the service, it is better not to have too much rehabilitation work to do because otherwise, you are pushed aside and there is no room for you in their schedule and therefore you can just wait to die.
It's only intensive care where I had a great experience, the rest is total detachment and you are considered to be in the slaughterhouse, you are considered an animal because they don't even speak to you anymore as if you were dead.

Surfer Paradise (SurferParadise.de),2025,English,"I recently visited one of Belgium's largest university hospitals, and overall, my experience was quite mixed. I must say, I am very impressed with how the administrative processes are handled, both in the emergency department and as a regular patient. It is quick and easy to find the right departments, and even as an English speaker, you are welcomed in a friendly manner.

I understand that a university hospital is used to train new doctors, which is completely reasonable.

However, what bothers me is that during several appointments, I was only seen by junior doctors. I would have appreciated the opportunity to occasionally see more experienced doctors directly, face-to-face, rather than just having the junior doctor consult them over the phone.

----------------------

Update: Unfortunately, I have to revise my previous review and lower the rating to 2 stars. Several attempts to make appointments have failed, and emails have either gone unanswered or, even worse, been ignored.

The situation mentioned above, involving junior doctors, has led to the point where another hospital is now taking care of me, as I was not satisfied with the treatment I received at UZ Leuven.

I regret having to give this hospital 2 stars because the administrative staff is incredibly efficient, but good administration cannot make up for the quality of treatment I experienced.

----------------------

Update:

Unfortunately, I must now downgrade UZ Leuven to a one-star rating. This is my second negative experience within a few months. Sadly, I have found that highly motivated junior doctors sometimes see ghosts where there are none. One might argue that they simply want to be thorough. However, when this approach ends up making a patient feel worse than they actually are, and when unnecessary and painful procedures are carried out, it has nothing to do with good medical care in my view.

So I was going to get radiation above where there were metastases and then amputation, but I didn't hear anything for 2 months and then yesterday I was spoken to so arrogantly and rudely by an assistant of Professor Friedl Sinnaeve, a young man my age called 'Maurice', that I had the option to be helped several times but I refused, no Maurice, I did not refuse chemo any other treatment. With that attitude and attitude I would better look for another job because you do work with cancer patients, more understanding and empathy would be nicer.

Struggling with my health for 8 years to finally hear that you have 2 cancers in your body, and that you are always treated so poorly and receive poor help, this is truly unbelievable.

The outcome of his treatment was disappointing, and when I expressed my concerns, he completely ignored me and acted as if it was my fault. Since he is so famous, I had high expectations, but they were completely dashed.

She told me I‚Äôve to go to my family doctor. I told her it takes time to have an appointment with my family doctor. She told me here too it takes time. She asked me did I take medication, pain killer, I said non. I want a prescription. I never self medicate myself. She was very rude and I don‚Äôt know what is she doing in a hospital? You never ask a person in pain to go somewhere else? It‚Äôs a very peculiar place in Leuven Belgium to send away patients. I‚Äôve waited 2 h and after all people ahead of me and those after me went to see a doctor, I was always waiting for some help but nothing. I left the emergency very disappointed and with pain.

Depending on the nature of the treatment, you will have a private meeting with a professional in urology for a consultation and consultation before a solution concerns the problem of debit and current urology, after the operation of the cysts les epididymes des testicles en Juin 2020 dans un autre h√¥pital .
Debut de la consultation par son collaborator , qui me fait part de la lecture de mon dossier m√©dical et me pose la question , avez-vous encore de l'espoir et qu'attendez vous de nous ?  You are very comfortable with your entrance and mati√®re.   Rapid visit of the professor to understand the medical history and minimize the urinary problems and the subsequent operation and explain the reasons for the problems encountered. The explanation of the explications of the urinary problem, but only the air of the interest.
Consultation termin√©e in 15 minutes.
The consultation report is minimalist, the first diagnosis of the problems of the douleurs and the urinary problems that are not the result of the origin of the urinary equipment but with certain nerves, the final solution for the clinical care of the douleur.
And the reason why you should consult a urologue at the Brussels hospital delta is to use an ultrasound scan and a cystograph to diagnose the urethral stenoses and your stenoses through the lobe prostatique.
It is advisable to ensure that certain medical procedures are taken into account and that the professional and urology of the hospital is the only specialist in the field of quality and the quality of care used by the examiners for diagnosis.
Very disappointed by their practice, which leaves me with a bitter taste and increasingly confirms for me the lack of empathy of certain doctors in this hospital towards the patients.  At the request of my treating physician, I have a private appointment with a professor of urology to ask his opinion and advice and perhaps a solution to my recurring urological flow problems and pain, after the operation of two cysts on the epididymides of the testicles in June 2020 in a other hospital.
Start of the consultation by his colleague, who tells me about reading my medical file and asks me the question: do you still have hope and what do you expect from us?  I am very surprised by this introduction.  Quick visit from the professor to hear my medical history, minimize my urinary problems and pain after my surgery and tell me that I have had health problems for years.  He listened absently to my explanation of my urinary problems, not seeming very interested.
Consultation completed within 15 minutes.
Very minimalist consultation report, according to his diagnosis my pain and urinary problems do not arise from my urinary tract but from certain nerves, the final recommended clinical solution for pain.
Desperate, I consulted a urologist at the Delta Hospital in Brussels, who, after an ultrasound and a cystogram, diagnosed three stenoses in the urethra and a verumontanum stenosis of the prostate lobe.

Had an appointment at a certain time, came from far away so was well on time, but they seemed to be busy with some kind of test and people who had put forward their candidacy, and that clearly got priority, probably more income from the pharmaceutical sector. Almost everyone seemed to be a student instead of a nurse. The person who carried out the test was correct but also had to call in the supervisor at a certain point because he was unsure about the actions. Eventually I was able to leave after 3 hours, lost half a day.

The specialist who made the referral cannot continue without a report based on the results, he said on the phone, which is why he referred me instead of in his own hospital, which did not do this. Apparently these weeks can take a while because only 1 or 2 people can interpret it correctly, and they don't have time. When I called for an appointment and they suggested 2 months later, he had already rejected that and emphasized that it was more urgent.

Between waiting weeks for a report and the specialist who only wants to pin an appointment when it is certain that it is there (apparently it can go either way so understandable) so another month easily passed. And in the meantime, pressure from the health insurance company on the patient because everything is dragging on... I would like nothing better than to be able to work again and for the pain to be gone... the family doctor who initially discovered it also warns of the risk of complications and serious matters and finds it unacceptable.

The cause of all my problems was that I had a gambling addiction, I saw no other way out then (see above in my article)
The first thing I did when I got home was to get myself excluded from the Gaming Commission so that I can no longer gamble online!!
Afterwards I received an email from the national lotto
Their words: ""It's a shame that you are leaving us on E-lotto, but you can still go to the newsagent for scratch cards and lotto/euromillions""

As a long-term patient at the UZ Gasthuisberg in Leuven, it is an hour's drive that I like to make. The hospital exudes impeccable cleanliness and care from the moment you enter.

Interaction with staff is always cordial, although I believe a cheerful attitude on both sides contributes to a pleasant experience. I always try to be the fun one, which can certainly brighten a nurse's day.

The waiting areas and facilities are comfortable and well maintained, making waiting for your turn, an inevitable aspect of any hospital visit, much more bearable.

Over the years I have been treated excellently and well taken care of by the medical staff, something for which I am very grateful.

Although recommending medical facilities can be a sensitive issue due to the inherent risks associated with medical procedures, I would still recommend UZ Gasthuisberg.

However, as I always say, it is important to choose with your gut feeling. Every medical situation is unique and what works for one person may not work for another.

One of the additional advantages of this hospital is the excellent parking facilities, which greatly facilitate access.

Looking back on my experience, I can't really think of anything that needs improvement; it appears to be a well-oiled system that functions efficiently.

Of course, there are some ups and downs on how nurses would approach you depending on circumstances. My overall experience has been great as nurses were friendly and doctors was great (even there is a time when they do want to sketch out the worse case scenario just so you won't get disappointed if something were to happen).

The hospital has 2 cafeterias to eat, one just nearby the entrances (great sandwitchs, pasteties and other stuffs for good prices) and it closes before 6pm if I am not mistaken. But there are other cafeteria which serves warm food besides salad and other stuffs, that opens til 8pm.

The accessibility of this hospital is good (enough parking spaces and you can also take the buses from the train station, if you want to know the time table, you can find the live status just before the main exits or just go at the bus stop where big board are listed).

I called the allergy department, they then told me that I had to wait until August for a consultation.

You can only contact a normal person six months later with an urgent problem!
Dermatology appointment: doesn't even look at the rash, just prescribes something and says I have to go to allergy.

Since the arrival of the new outpatient center, many incorrect diagnoses have been made and many incorrect interventions have been performed.
in the outpatient center you can immediately sense the stressful, toxic atmosphere. you already feel that it is no longer the way it used to be.
Nowadays many diseases are also attributed as ""mental"" or you need to ""adjust"" nutrition by a dietician.
while that is never the case.
They can help in easy cases, but when it becomes complex they say ""it's all in your mind"". and there is the door.
the good doctors have not been working in this hospital for a long time and there is a strong spillover between different hospitals.
It's sad to say, but this hospital is no longer like any other and has deteriorated significantly in the field of ""treatments"" and patient care.

Doctors tell me not to act and that it is between my two ears.
this hospital has become rude and no longer follows up on proper treatments at all.
all they want is to be in the spotlight on pubmed/researchgate or some other page where they get ""attention"".
has really become a rude hospital.

With pain in my heart I have to say goodbye to this hospital because they no longer listen to me.

My symptoms are back and now I don't even know the evolution of the condition after the treatment.

After speaking to the clinic, they claim that such a bill of that amount is only for a stay of weeks or months.

My father has an inflammation of the liver, pancreas and the 12 finger intestine. My father has to continue taking antibiotics. That is why he went to the Netherlands Rotterdam as soon as possible to continue his treatment.

Christiane Meys,2021,Dutch,"I recently went for a consultation with my 89-year-old mother at the eye disease department. She had to undergo several tests (the same as a month ago) and we spent 2h30 there with a mask. Until then because of the crowds, but not so obvious for my mother. What really bothered me was the fact that we (my mother, I and a nurse), now in full corona period, were in a small room for the tests, but after 10 minutes another nurse came in with another patient for testing as well. Still during these tests, another lady came in and out of the room 3 to 4 times to get something and when my mother was almost done, another lady came in to take tests, luckily her patient waited outside!! So there were 6 to 7 people in that small room!!!!

After an hour of waiting, the doctor's diagnosis was ""we need to close the wounds with stitches, and then he'll be fine."" The doctor then went back to his computer for 30 minutes without returning.

With parental instinct, we decided to leave and go directly to Brussels to the emergency room at St. Luc Hospital. We were immediately seen by the doctor with his diagnosis: ""When a child is bitten by a dog with open lesions that aren't too deep, never close the wounds with stitches or glue because you'll trap bacteria from the dog's mouth, and it can become infected. So always leave the wounds open and disinfect them with iso-betadine and take antibiotics for 5 days.""

Melissa Hgd,2019,Dutch,"When you hear the name `uz Leuven`, you immediately think of the best, most modern hospital in Belgium, perhaps even in Europe.
Well, from personal experience I know that this is ABSOLUTELY not the case.
A few years ago I developed chronic pain, and after a while we ended up at the Uz Leuven with hope.
After a waiting period of six months I was finally able to see the specialist, who of course only came in for 5 minutes, and three months later I had to come back.
In the meantime I had an appointment at the orthopedic department for my back.
A doctor came in, together with his male intern.
This doctor treated me so badly that I had to cry, and his intern started crying too, so you can imagine the atmosphere.
The arrogance was dripping off, with all the doctors in Leuven by the way, because they work in `LEUVEN`.
He was arrogant, rude, not an ounce of sympathy...
After three months I had another appointment with the first doctor.
He wasn't there. Suddenly a female doctor comes, who says that they can't do anything and whether I have thought about taking a Dafalgan (!), and otherwise I should go to England for hypnosis.
The interior is also not at all what one expects for the `most modern hospital in Belgium`, but old and worn out, really not even a decent cafeteria.

I also didn't see the professor I was supposed to see, I got a different doctor... The doctor said if you wanted to see him as normal, you would have had to wait another year and a half! Scandalous! By the way, they should indicate better in the hospital itself where you need to be.. It took us almost 10 minutes to find the right waiting room.. We had to ask several people, are we in the right place or how should we go..

Dennis Verstralen,2025,Dutch,"Last Monday I visited the UZ Hospital in Leuven for the first time with my wife. My wife had been referred by the cardiologist in Turnhout for the placement of a new heart valve. Doctor Nuyens, together with the professor in Leuven, would take care of a new heart valve. I arrived in Leuven by car and was initially shocked by the size of the hospital, but after I had parked my car and had us registered, from that moment on it felt very familiar. After being welcomed from reception to admission by very friendly, knowledgeable staff, as well as by a very caring nurse, Marian was admitted on Sunday evening. On Monday around 13:00 the new heart valve was placed. This procedure did not have to be done with an open heart operation but was done via the groin. The operation was successful and despite the high workload of Dr Nuyens he still took the trouble to call me as his wife immediately to say: the operation was difficult but went very well. After Marian had been in the cardiac monitoring unit for a few hours, she was allowed to return to her room where I visited her that same evening. Once again I was taken care of by the loving nurse, this was not only noticed by me but also by Marian. On Tuesday around 18:00 the doctor came by with the message that all examinations after the operation had been completed and that the result was very satisfactory and he gave her permission to return home.
Personally I think this is a wonderful operation and I would like to express my great appreciation to Dr. Nuyens and his staff as well as certainly the nurse and I am glad that we were given the opportunity to have the operation performed by the UZ hospital in Leuven.
For that my great thanks,

M Herrera,2025,Dutch,"March 30, 2025, in the evening

I would like to express my appreciation for the wonderful care I received during my emergency room visit on the evening of March 30.

From the first moment the receptionist was incredibly friendly, empathetic and professional. Despite not speaking the local language, she explained everything to me with patience, a smile and a lot of calm: where to wait, what to do, and she recorded my details with great care and respect. In a stressful situation that was a real relief.

Then I was helped by the gynecologist, and she was just fantastic. She made me feel that I was in good hands: friendly, calm, clear and very attentive. I felt comfortable, heard and respected.

I am a foreign visitor who came here on holiday, and I really leave with a very nice image of this special place. What quality, what dedication, what beautiful humanity there is in this hospital.

In 2014, I had my accident, and the hospital where I was treated kept telling me that I needed time to heal, while I kept complaining of extreme pain. If they had taken my complaints seriously in that hospital, I could have been completely healed now instead of being left with a small disability.

By choosing a second opinion, I was literally able to keep my leg. Before the operation, there was no certainty whether my leg could be saved or whether an amputation was necessary. I cannot thank the entire team enough for their approach, from the first contact with the care provider to my discharge. They were always there, even if it was just to get something off your chest.

J S DC,2025,Dutch,"My trajectory at UZ Gent started when I was 12 years old, for guidance on gender dysphoria. Unfortunately, this has developed into one of the worst experiences of my life. The follow-up was substandard from the start: from child psychologist to plastic surgery.

My future wish to have children was never taken into account. Prof. Monstrey followed me further within plastic surgery - a decision that I now consider to be the biggest mistake of my life. The communication was downright bad. The operation was eventually performed by a student under his supervision, and this went wrong. Numerous complications followed, and the urology team was completely ignored, resulting in even more problems on the urological level.

I was later promised corrections by the plastic team, once everything had healed. But those promises were not kept. I did not receive proper aftercare, which has now left me with trauma. Despite my fear, I returned to the plastic surgery department, with an appointment with Prof. Buncamper. He refused any form of correction, although this had been promised earlier. Instead, I received a card from a tattoo artist who could tattoo ‚Äúrealistically‚Äù. I could clearly see from the photos that it was a belly flap ‚Äì when I mentioned this, I was immediately dismissed without explanation.

My attempts to seek help again always ended in disappointment. Even with the lymphatic doctor: my hand has been swollen for 10 years after the operation, but the doctor did not look at me and simply sent me away again. Once again I had gathered courage and made time ‚Äì for nothing.

The treatment for nerve pain on the scars (via fat injections) also had no effect.

Subsequently, the ombudsman service also did not provide proper assistance. I am not in the habit of writing negative reviews (feel free to check my profile), but I see no other option than to warn others about this experience. For irregular and unexplained pain in my right ear, I made an appointment online at the ENT department and I was given an appointment with the doctor in question quickly. I was welcomed coldly, with hardly any contact being made and the gentleman mainly looked at his computer screen. Apparently my medical file was being looked at on Cozo all the time and this doctor opened a total of 11 documents (my own GP has never opened so many documents on this platform). He didn't actually listen to my story, but formed a picture based on all these documents. This includes an overview of the medications I took in the past. He asked me what medication I took and I answered honestly that I sometimes took some painkillers or anti-inflammatories. But he did not believe this because of my medication schedule that was open on the screen (which I could not see, it was set up that way). He forgot that there was also an end date for this medication. When he asked what medication I was taking, he did not accept my answer, but assumed that I was still taking all the medication listed. Apparently he could not or did not want to read that these were no longer taken and did not believe me. At this point he became verbally aggressive, his attitude became intimidating and I was basically humiliated. I was no longer believed in my story because of the tests that could not show anything and my medical past. A consultation five years earlier in another hospital was dragged into this whole and used against me. It was suggested (not literally said) by the man who calls himself a doctor that I had other problems. Since I didn't say what medication I was taking (which I did), he claimed I was acting like the medical expert in the room. This situation got completely out of hand. He came across as non-verbally deceptive because of his posture, his wide eyes, the gestures with his arms and his choice of words. I felt completely intimidated and unhelped. I also had the impression that he did not fully understand me, Dutch is clearly not his first language. When I talked about physical problems he clearly understood them as psychological ones. I was then virtually forced out of the practice without any prospects of help or treatment. At the end he literally said that the hospital services could learn from this experience by not taking someone in faster than me. I have no idea what I did to deserve this insult. I brought this entire story to the ombudsman service, but they could not tell me anything other than that they had forwarded the story to the doctor by email, but he did not respond. They went to report my story to the head of department, but here too I received no follow-up. And the ultimate sad thing is that I paid for this appointment.

The answer he got was ""we think it is a metastasis of the esophagus"", they could not say what the cause was. Before he was admitted, he first asked how long he had to live before the brain tumors would break out again, the answer we got from the oncologist was ""your life expectancy is until around summer, and with the radiation everything would go better again"". Of course this turned out not to be the case and I personally think that is something that is not possible, as an oncologist you should always be sure of your answer, and that was completely different here at the UZ Gent.

Lukas,2024,Dutch,"Dear

Last week my father spent three days in rehabilitation at the Ghent University Hospital after a knee prosthesis. Due to a shortage of places in the rehabilitation department, he was placed in another department. The care, and especially the pain management, was substandard.

(I am an emergency and intensive care nurse myself, and my father is a judge. I mention our professions explicitly because it seems as if some nurses are quick to make judgments and think that patients are exaggerating or seeking attention,...
My father was not taken seriously.)

1. Pain management and poor follow-up

The nurses' primary goal was to control my father's pain, but that didn't happen. He did not sleep a wink during his stay due to the enormous pain. This despite the fact that the attending physician had prescribed Oxynorm on the first day for use if necessary during his stay. My father was given this medication only once.
Why was receiving Oxynorm an absolute 'no-go' for the nurses, while this was explicitly allowed by the doctor?

In addition, my father was entitled to a new ice pack every two hours (at 2 a.m. and 4 a.m.), as it gets warm and is therefore no longer effective. However, he never received this during the night, even after he explicitly requested it from the night nurse, who replied bluntly: ""No, we're not going to do that, no time.""

2. Inconsistent policies regarding medication

The explanation my father received about his pain management differed per nurse. So many didn't seem to know that he could receive Oxynorm? Every request regarding this medication was always refused.
There was also a lot of confusion about whether or not to administer diclofenac. Some nurses refused to give this because of his hypertension, while others indicated that it was possible. The reason they gave for not giving it was because diclofenac can increase blood pressure, but this increase is minimal. In that case, why wasn't his blood pressure simply checked, instead of withholding this medication for no apparent reason?

In the end, my father only received paracetamol per os and very occasionally diclofenac, supplemented with an ice pack every now and then. This was completely inadequate considering the intensity of his pain, which was barely evaluated.

3. Neglect of other patients

Besides my father, there was another patient who was immobile. At one point this man urgently needed to urinate, but no urine bottle was provided. My mother reported this to a nurse who was at the computer, but she indicated that she had ""no time"" to help. My mother had to ask where the urine bottle was located so that she could give it to the patient. Unfortunately it was already too late; the patient had wet his bed. This could easily have been prevented with a little attention and care.

Conclusion

The care provided during my father's stay was far below standard. The lack of adequate pain control, ignoring doctor's orders, conflicting information about medication and the lack of basic care for other patients are not only worrying, but also unacceptable.

I am ashamed of how the nurses treated my father. This type of negligence and lack of care gives our profession a bad name.
Hopefully not all patients are treated in this way by the nurses involved. Fortunately, my father found two nurses who did their work with dedication and care, and he was satisfied with them.

Yours sincerely

Marcel,2024,Dutch,"Referred by a regional hospital for a second opinion on a complicated large wound. Previously had two successful operations in a regional hospital. In the hospital they would see whether plastic surgery would be an additional option.
Upon arrival it turned out that the provided medical file could not be found, the doctor and assistants in question behaved curtly and quite adhoc or aggressively. Before my treatment I had negative pressure therapy in a sealed cast. People were incensed that they had to remove the plaster cast...but without it they could not inspect the wound...so they had to remove it...that was not done without a struggle and with clear reluctance...they looked at the wound for a maximum of two minutes...all my questions were not answered (reasonably medically trained from home)..I was almost personally blamed for not having been involved in the healing process earlier...and then only had to make a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks. (involvement??) ...they turned out to be unable to change the negative pressure therapy while I had all the necessary bandages, etc. with me
had taken with me (?) and was also unable to place a new cast (because I would have had to make an appointment for a plaster room(?) to deal with it, an inferior connection was made with the message that I had to go back to my regional hospital for negative pressure therapy, wound care and a new cast..
Conclusion..
Extremely patient unfriendly. Asking relevant questions is not appreciated and therefore not answered. very high-minded and not very empathetic. Unprofessional and lack of knowledge of relevant medical treatment methods..

Achilles tendon loss at the end of January. Went to UZ GENT ortho department. No surgery required.

THOMAS DECOCK, DR . JULIEN VAN DEN BROUCKE, DR. GERT VAN DER VELDE, DR. ALEXANDER GALANT.
Fortunately, I was admitted to the Orthakliniek in Deurne today. 6 months of rehabilitation for nothing. Should have had surgery immediately.

Virtually no responses from invoicing dept when payments were queried. A couple of times we issued payments, with proof on our bank statements but got continually billed by invoicing for the same payments. I sent an email to invoicing and fertility dept highlighting my concerns but no response received. My husband tried using a payment link which didn‚Äôt work, he emailed to ask for help. No response received and we got a letter from bailiffs for payment because invoicing didn‚Äôt respond to his email!

Communication is just shocking. I suggest if you‚Äôre an international client you seriously consider if this is the hospital for your treatment, as we‚Äôve found this experience very poor to say the least!!

Update 20th March
We‚Äôve received another invoice!! No correspondence of what this relates to but codes which do not relate to any of our paperwork so do not understand why we were billed again! I emailed the ombudsman as you suggested asking for further information. Four weeks later no response from the ombudsman but a new bill. This was not from UZGhent but their bailiffs, yet again.

Y S,2024,English,"Review for UZ Gent Cardiac Department.

This year, I was diagnosed with congenital heart disease known as ""Sinus Venosus ASD,"" abbreviated as PAPVR + ASD. Despite being asymptomatic, the diagnosis came as a shock. I embarked on a journey of understanding my condition and exploring potential treatments.

Through extensive research and consultations with various surgeons, I discovered three surgical options available to me:

1. Sternotomy open-heart operation.
2. Thoracotomy minimal invasion.
3. Transcatheter minimal invasion.

Choosing the right approach was a challenging decision. I would strongly advise seeking detailed consultations with surgeons to thoroughly understand the associated risks before making a choice. In my case, I personally opted for option 1, as it seemed to offer a safer solution for my specific congenital condition.

Selecting a surgeon proved to be no less complex, given that I consulted with more than 8 specialists across different countries. The key is to establish the right connection with your chosen surgeon, for me this was with Prof. Dr. Katrien Francois at UZ Gent Hospital.
Now that I've been discharged from the hospital and back in the comfort of my home, I feel fantastic and healthy. Notably, I believe I have been left with the coolest and nearly invisible scar on my chest. I am truly grateful to Professor Francois and her dedicated team for providing exceptional care throughout my journey.

UZ is the only hospital we can go to for this, unfortunately we cannot go to Maria Middel Lares for this. From the 1st appointment there is already misery with the hospital, not keeping appointments, passing on/booking appointments incorrectly and simply not sending a confirmation email or text message, let alone sending a reminder, let them know and they will not reveal the error to you. that you don't have any problems with this and other hospitals are correct, they don't know what to say and they find this strange because no one has any problems. Now I call today when my daughter had her new appointment, since I didn't remember and I didn't have an email, I was told that an appointment has been scheduled with the doctor within 3 days. I was out of the blue for a while, just beginning. September and had to go back to the doctor in April, I needed an appointment for an injection and a blood test, they said that the appointment was on Tuesday, it was now Monday, I have no confirmation email, had no text message or telephone that there was an appointment on Tuesday . I then say, I want a new appointment, they just say you can listen on Wednesday when the doctor calls, I don't deal with the doctor, but with the nurse. so I stand my ground so I say no, I'm now making an appointment for my daughter, it didn't really make sense, normally I would receive a confirmation email tomorrow, I'm curious.

this hospital is for me 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 worth stars
If I had to go to another hospital, I would do so immediately, they cannot give proper appointments, the doctor cannot deal with children, you do not tell a girl of almost 10 years that she is too heavy, a child can develop an eating disorder like this

and in short, the doctor simply makes appointments with parents of which both have not been informed, I have a feeling that this is what happens, the doctor sets appointments in order to have time for himself, if I want it a bit quieter then I take leave from the doctors, this apparently works differently they book so-called patients

This is certainly not the best hospital, on the contrary for me this is the worst hospital ever, it is clear why this is called the cheapest hospital",UZ Gent

Here everything goes wrong, people are put on hold in the waiting room and you see +30 patients after you being treated earlier.
The nursing staff takes over places where patients will lie down after surgery, this is because the old staff cannot handle the faster system and let patients make their own plans. There was no fresh clothing for surgery, what we received had already been used. Here you will find proof that you do NOT have to look for respect for nursing in corona times.

Sofie R,2022,Dutch,"Very bad experience with this so-called 'university hospital'. To me it is not worthy of that name. Here you are just a number. The well-being of the patient is not important at all, they are only after your money. Firstly, the hospital is terribly poorly organized and the communication between the services is also substandard. You are simply sent from here to there without any results, with extremely long waiting times in between. Especially a very bad experience with doctor ARNE BURSSENS (orthopaedist). I had a problem in both feet. The doctor didn't even think it was necessary to look at my feet (he remained sitting behind his desk) or to refer me ?!!!!! He diagnosed me with tarsal tunnel on both feet which in retrospect was completely wrong!! He didn't even bother to look at the results of my previous tests... Ultimately, after a long wait, I ended up in the pain clinic where the nurse at the counter was extremely unfriendly. They had tried a treatment and it did not work and she informed me in a very unfriendly way that she could not help me further and that I had to look for other solutions myself... Ultimately I ended up at a private clinic in Melle where I was listened to and where the doctor gave me a completely different and this time correct diagnosis and without long waiting times. My advice: DO NOT go to a university hospital and certainly not UZ-Gent. A smaller clinic makes more effort and it goes much smoother and faster.",UZ Gent

Physical medicine (for people with injuries and trauma to the musculoskeletal system) has no (!) parking!

So you have to use the tower parking which is often full, and is usually not an option and is a few hundred meters from the entrance of physical medicine.  So, there is no other option for me than to park illegally to get as close as possible to my mother. Then you run the risk of your car being towed. And that for people with limited mobility!

No other hospital, anywhere, can match all of you in the UZ Gent Team! Your generally people-friendly, helpful hearts have already healed many ailments and wounds!
Likewise, all doctors and medical staff, from whatever service (blood collection service, PoliBas, orthopedic secretariat, internal care department of orthopedics staff, etc.) are like no other place in Belgium - I scoured enough hospitals to find out about this. to dare to express - so competent, so progressive and at the same time passionately working for people. Unlike other hospitals, human well-being is still central here. My sincere compliments to the general directors who do a fantastic job with their 'screenwork'!

Liesbeth,2025,Dutch,"I've been coming here for years. The doctors are knowledgeable, but waiting times for a specialist can be long, especially when there's a preference. Treatment is always discussed with the patient as much as possible, unless a dry message is the only option.
At sensitive moments, doctors support patients where they can; performing magic is unfortunately impossible‚Äîeven in a university hospital. Some problems are insoluble, and loss is a part of life.
One potential point for improvement, however, is the registration process. There's room for improvement there. Recently, I wanted to get directions from the machine; I'd just removed my ID. Before I knew it, the machine had swallowed the slip of paper with the directions. Privacy is one thing, but swallowing an important piece of paper after only 10 seconds is too fast. I knew which floor I needed to be on, but the number was a guess. Lost time and late arrival were the result.
I reported the problem, and they said they would ask technical support to extend the time between removing the ID and printing the paper. I have to go back in a few months, so to be continued.",UZ Antwerpen
Melisteria,2025,Dutch,"Review for UZA Emergency Department ‚Äì ‚Äã‚ÄãNight of Friday July 4, 2025

On Friday evening, July 4, 2025, I arrived at the emergency department of UZA around 7:30 PM with a severe allergic reaction. My skin was swelling, my throat was narrowing and my entire body was covered in red spots. Nevertheless, I was placed in a room, where I had to wait for more than 5 hours before I saw a doctor. (from under a photo of my foot with the spots) this is what my entire body looked like.

When a doctor finally came in, I was told:
‚ÄúWhat do you want us to do about this?‚Äù
A completely inappropriate response, especially for someone who was visibly in trouble. Because I was in shock, I simply replied:
‚ÄúYour job.‚Äù
The doctor then disappeared ‚Äúto look at my file‚Äù and was gone for more than an hour. He came back, took a quick look at the rash on my skin and disappeared again for almost an hour. Around midnight he came back with the message:
""I can't help you if you don't have a fever.""

In the meantime my condition deteriorated: my face felt paralyzed, my lips were swollen and rock hard, and I felt my throat closing up more and more. My friend and I then drove straight to the hospital in Reet (Rivierenland).

The approach there was completely different: within 10 minutes I was given an injection, an IV and I was taken seriously. The doctor there confirmed that my situation was serious and even said that if I had come 10 minutes later, things could have ended much worse.

I am writing this review in the hope that UZA takes this feedback seriously. What I experienced there was downright disappointing and dangerous. I was in a room for 5 hours with an allergic reaction that could have been life-threatening, and received hardly any help. That is not how an emergency room is supposed to work.",UZ Antwerpen

Marie Buelens,2025,Dutch,"In general, I have always been satisfied with this hospital, but I still have to get this off my chest.

My mother was previously admitted to the C5 department (gastrointestinal diseases), and the nursing there was anything but professional. Whenever I rang the bell for my mother, students kept coming, which is good in itself, but from the moment there was something that the student could not solve, we often had to wait more than an hour before permanent staff arrived. When I called again after 30 minutes (also because I was leaving), the same student came again to help. When I repeated the question, the student apologized and indicated that she was going to ask again. When I walked outside I saw that the permanent staff was in the refectory and that the students were working in the nursing station.  This has happened several times. It is good to have students, but the intention is not for them to take over all the work. If I was lucky enough to speak to someone from the permanent nursing staff, they were often rude. Another time when I came to visit, there was a care going on in the room across the street. Unfortunately I could see and hear everything unwanted because the door was completely open. In addition, there was a finely built nurse who said quite loudly that she hates obese people because she destroys her back on people who don't want to do anything about their weight. I'm not one of the thinnest myself, so it was anything but nice to hear that, let's just keep quiet about how that patient must have felt. During another visit, my mother told me that the nurses had caused her a lot of pain during wound care. I don't know the exact circumstances, but my mother did indicate that the nurse shouted several times that she should not exaggerate. Then the limit was reached for me and I asked at the nursing station to speak to the head nurse. Unfortunately, the head nurse turned out not to be much different. I was allowed to tell my story at the door of the nursing station in front of everyone, instead of having to take myself aside. Every time I said the charge nurse responded defensively and indicated that her team doesn't do those things. After a while I didn't even feel like saying anything anymore.

I was very happy that my mother could return home. She had lost weight and was covered in bruises. We had home care nurses come to care for her further and luckily this went well.

I can only speak well about the doctors. The doctor in the department has also always been helpful to me. The examinations and consultations went perfectly.

Momo,2025,English,"At the start of a leg operation (under loco-regional anesthesia), the surgeon went straight to the wrong leg! Normally he would have noticed at one point that the leg was not marked or disinfected, but it still did not instill much confidence...

During the operation, six leg muscle samples were eventually taken, covering at least 10 cm of leg muscle and taking considerable time, whereas I had only been informed of the extraction of one or two muscle samples. As the muscle could not be anesthesised, this caused quite some discomfort.

After the operation, I had to wait for the results of the biopsy until 16.00. During all this time, I received one small bottle of water, a small pack of orange juice and a small industrial Madeleine cookie. No coffee or tea was offered, no breakfast or lunch, whereas I had not been allowed to eat or drink anything since midnight the previous day. As I could not walk, I was not able to get anything from the cafetaria. It would be good if the hospital would at least inform the patients of this Spartan regime before the operation, for instance during the prep-operative call the previous day.

I also wonder why a hospital would offer such unhealthy fare to its patients. Hospitals could contribute to healthier eating habits by setting the right example.

On the positive side, the nurses were friendly and professional, although when I had to urinate in a bed pan, I was not offered any wet (or dry) towels to clean myself afterwards.

All in all, the experience was less reassuring than at UZ Leuven, where one can sense a much more positive and welcoming atmosphere, also amongst the team members of the various teams. Clearly a better-managed hospital!",UZ Antwerpen

Marleen Mees,2025,Dutch,"Contacting the UZA is particularly frustrating: either you end up on a long waiting list, or your call is simply disconnected or you hear a busy signal.
That was mainly my experience with the ENDOCRINOLOGY department. I could not possibly contact the secretariat. After sending an email in which I asked the endocrinologist for advice regarding my medication, I received (of course) an automatic response in my mailbox, but nothing more. I am still waiting for a response from the doctor. Isn't the patient always entitled to advice?
Finally, I finally got through to the ombudswoman with my dissatisfaction, who actually told me that ""she could not do anything about it because the head of the department (endocrinologist) had told her that the department was understaffed."" Apparently, you can explain all possible abuses with that. A clich√©. The patient is left hungry. I assumed that an ombudsman service always had to defend the patient and not the hospital.

He is 87 years old, has been receiving treatment at the UROLOGY department for years. During the last six months he has been in pain and the daughters have to go to the emergency room at the UZA or to the emergency room at the local clinic almost every week. Every time he has to make an appointment at the UROLOGY department, the treating doctor says that they are going to plan a procedure, but these always turn out to be empty promises. Sometimes it is as if people at that service find it annoying that my father-in-law is there again. Why is the situation not clear? If the procedure is no longer possible due to his state of health or advanced age, this should be communicated to my father-in-law and family. But conversations at the Urology department never provide clarity, but some humanity is welcome. After all, no one comes to a clinic for pleasure, not as a patient and not as guidance!

Rebecca,2024,Dutch,"I had a terrible experience in the neurology department where I spent a week and was traumatized. Extremely unfriendly nurses (apart from 2 nurses and 1 very sweet nurse). I suffered inhumane pain and only saw assistants. I arrived at the emergency room and was given a lumbar puncture with pressure measurement by an assistant who stabbed the wrong number numerous times and asked my mother to assist him (?). Luckily my mom went to get a nurse. After a few hours I got a horrible headache. My meninges were torn, which showed up on the scan the next day because there was a leak in my spinal cord from which cerebrospinal fluid was leaking. According to the assistant neurologist, this was due to my epidural 6 years (!!) ago and was the cause of my pain for which I went to the emergency room in the first place. This was the first diagnosis. The leak was of course the result of the improper puncture performed the day before.

Only after 3 long days was I finally able to go to the pain clinic for a blood patch, which also lasted 2 hours (!) instead of 20 minutes. 2 hours with unbearable pain and that needle in the back because they couldn't find any blood to draw.

When I was discharged I was diagnosed with migraine, which was also a wrong diagnosis as it turned out.
I became temporarily blind a few days after my discharge, but according to the assistant neurologist there was nothing wrong and that I could no longer tolerate my glasses when I was discharged. I have suffered so much unnecessary excruciating pain on top of the pain and condition I was admitted for. I didn't eat for a week, because I couldn't move or sit up and my food was just put next to my bed. I didn't wash for a whole week, because I could supposedly do it myself, even though I couldn't lift my head, let alone my body. I couldn't even go to the toilet and sometimes had to wait 1 hour for a bedpan when I rang the bell.
I had my period so I had to wear a diaper. Inhuman, as if I were in a third world country!! The doctors in the pain clinic were very friendly.

They really work against their will in the neurology department and most of them do not have an ounce of empathy and were sullen and angry. This was even confirmed by the few who do their best there. So it is known internally that it is a hell department.

A few days after my discharge I was admitted to another hospital. They had never seen such two blue arms from an IV there. Every time I was injected in the hospital, this was done very brutally, especially by the large male nurse who walked around there. My IV was leaking so had to be moved every day. This was too much trouble. One night my IV was inserted into the crook of my elbow. I had to sleep with my arm stretched out, because every time I fell asleep the alarm went off and they weren't happy about that.
One time while clearing my IV while administering my medication, the needle popped halfway out of my arm, but the nurse didn't have time so I lay there for over an hour with the blood pouring out of my vein and a needle still half way in.
This was truly a stay in hell!",UZ Antwerpen

MDBG,2024,Dutch,"0/5. Non-existent, even destructive service.
Urology assistant discriminates against you in front of you and your partner about your choice not to have children and refuses you care by
by making up laws, rules, etc. on the spot and openly admitting that he discriminates against you based on age. Second opinions from several experts directly contradicted him.

Once we tested Mr.'s 'legal basis' on the spot, this turned out to be virtually untrue (we suspect that this treatment came from personal conviction) and we were quickly dismissed to prevent worse for him. VITAZ Sint-Niklaas has now helped us enormously with excellent services. I highly recommend hearing there first. In any case, I will never enter Urology at UZA again. EDIT: Dr. Claeys at VITAZ helped me very well and I was even treated twice as quickly as at the UZA, provided they had not discriminated. Karma!

Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed in thinking that the UZA was above such practices.

EDIT: After contact with the ombudsperson, it was made clear that nothing will be done about this in the interest of 'the well-being of the patient' and that a slightly younger man without children (around 25) would be better off being treated for sterilization elsewhere. They kept quiet about lying about non-existent laws and other nonsense, but I'm afraid this is not a coincidence. Even after further feedback that there was a cover-up in this regard, we received a short answer and that was it.

Dear people, you have been warned: AVOID UROLOGY HERE!!! You will be played bingo and a decision will be made *for* you instead of *with* you without taking circumstances into account. You are a number!

Once we were done, we asked her if there was anything else for us to do, to complete the discharge (this was our first time at the ER).

- A surgeon who claims that my disease will never come back after an immense operation, less than a year later this disease is back. Didn't get any explanation about how or what, the message is just learn to live with it.
- A neurologist who prescribes immunotherapy to young women and does not understand the impact of this and who
the patient completely denies symptoms. Medical gaslighting at its finest. Because of this I cannot get pregnant, I was never told in advance.
- An ophthalmologist who sees you for 2 minutes and doesn't even have the respect to say goodbye properly when leaving.

Anita Vlaminck,2022,Dutch,"a year ago on September 4, 2020, I had surgery at the UZA following a fracture of my femur at the level of the femoral head, I was told that the best solution would be a gamma nail. Now I had polio as a child, which resulted in osteoporosis in the same leg. Now on September 17, 2021 I will be in a wheelchair or walking with crutches and probably for the rest of my life. I still cannot walk or support my knee joint and I have to deal with a lot of pain every day and therefore also serious sleeping problems. I was told by my regular orthopedist that the gamma nail was not the best solution, given the poor condition of my bone, but Doctor N from the UZA insists on having a hip prosthesis. Now I know that if the gamma nail were removed, there is a good chance that my bone will completely crumble; as a result, I will have to have my leg amputated. So if I could go below zero or give no stars I would do so.

The medical staff very attentive and smiling, eager to help. We all understood each other in English.
Cleaning, large salons with wc in salon. The toilet has toilet paper and there are chairs and toilet paper in the lounge area. In the salon there were surgical masks and gloves, a flat water bottle with a disposable cup, disinfectant solution that was actually full. The living room is also equipped with a closet for clothes and a smaller closet with a mini-fridge and a drawer with a code. Soap, I didn't understand why it's not in such conditions, but no...
What seemed strange to me about Romania is the fact that everyone in the hospital is dressed in their home clothes, not pajamas, and what I didn't like at all is the fact that both the medical staff and the admitted patients walk around in outside shoes. In Romania, medical staff and patients wear indoor shoes. Many microbes are brought in from outside.

Sophie Hansart,2019,Dutch,"Made an appointment months in advance at 9:50 am. The day before, still no message with directions to the hospital. Then I called myself and received confirmation that I had to be there at that time via a certain route.  The person who actually made the appointment, Junior, had put my phone number in the wrong box. An hour later I narrowly miss a phone because I am changing my son, I immediately receive a call back and arrive at an exchange that immediately called me back because they did not know who had called. No more phone calls. I leave for my appointment on time and suddenly receive a message that I have to be there half an hour earlier. When I arrived completely stressed, I checked in. The lady at the counter tells me casually that she knew Junior, he often makes mistakes and oh, don't stress because the surgeon is still in the operating room and the first appointment has already been waiting for more than an hour. It is now extremely difficult for me to provide care for my two sons (physically limited) and I have quite a bit of experience with hospitals because of this and I have not experienced this in the last year. Well organized at UZ Leuven and UZ Sint Maarten, on time, clear where you need to be in advance so that you can plan everything with those at home. And if that doctor will be in the operating theater for many hours to come, should he notify the patients so that their appointment can be rescheduled? What a disappointment!

Anna Vi,2019,English,"Very sad experience in pediatrie today. Left our whole family completely broken. Our 10 month baby had a severe rash after wrong advice of a pediatre and didn‚Äôt sleep all night before the MRI. She was crying her heart out and scratching her belly to blood. She was not allowed to eat or drink for 10 hours  before..We had to hold her hands to prevent her from scratching all the way to the hospital. They said pediatre will come but it turned out to be only assistant. She said she has a cream for it and she will make sure it will be put straight after procedure when the baby wakes up. The procedure was 3h late, the doctor has disappeared, none of the nurses informed us what to do. The baby woke up after anaesthesia and started itching like crazy. They said the doctor will come to examine within 30 min max or even faster. Guess what? The doctor never came, her assistant came 2 hours later only with prescription that we already had from before ( the previous doctor promised to put medicine straight away and disappeared forever). On top of that if you ask something they always say how busy they are and how they have a queue of 100 dying babies to make you feel guilty for this while 5 nurses are chatting in the reception. This is complete misguisguidance, horrific time management and false promises. If we knew it would be like that - we wouldn‚Äôt waste 3-4h of time after not sleeping for 24h while our baby is suffering  and will have found a different solution. We were falsely adviced by nurses or the assistant on the phone that doctor is coming any minute throughout 3 h time while baby was hungry and in terrible rush. Nobody checks the baby and said if we can leave or not. With this unskillful time management and lack of organisation it‚Äôs no surprise there is a queue of babies who need help and no time for treat them. All they told me is that if your baby isn‚Äôt dying it‚Äôs ok. At least we could be informed not to waste our time and let our baby suffer, but no one at all seemed to care at route number 10.",UZ Antwerpen

I got a very unkind nurse the first day who treated me like I was a 5-year-old child who did something bad all the time & was not capable of doing the simple task of putting correctly in the computer what I wanted to eat of the menu. Constantly denegrating comments...! If you don't like your current job, please quit instead of spreading your unhapiness on to your patients.
I have sleep deprivation for more than 4 years, which showed in the test results and was sent back home with only a stupid comment that I'm responsible for it myself, when I tried every method there is to get more sleep. You need years of getting a degree at university to call yourself a specialist, but you are unable of fixing a standard sleeping issue...?

R,2019,Dutch,"Top hospital.
I have browsed through the reviews and I notice that many people are not satisfied with their waiting times. For these people I have a reality check.
This is a hospital, not a cash register of the GB where the first in line is also the first to leave. No. This is a hospital, here the rule is that the people who are most in danger of life get priority. So while you are waiting with your hernia or your cold sore, it is possible that the doctors are first busy with the people who have just been brought in by ambulance who have just had a serious car accident. Saving lives. I can imagine that your hernia hurts and your cold sore looks suspicious, but a broken neck and internal bleeding are just a little more urgent.
Give the staff some respect and time, if you press the bell 5 times during an urgent intervention, you may well have to wait even longer because you are forcing a member of staff to come to you.

Moreover, if you start lashing out at a hospital on Google like David Verbelen below, you should really be ashamed of yourself. ""As CEO of one of the largest companies in Belgium. Sir, you are an independent florist...

If you really want to lash out at the hospital, I can advise you to do this directly at the UZA itself, to their ombudsman or the complaints department. (Yes, they have them there!) Google reviews will not solve this for you.",UZ Antwerpen

First I had to wait an hour before we were allowed to go to the room, then without any news (I had to remain sober the entire time) I had to wait until 15:30 in the afternoon for an operation that was scheduled for the morning.

Good morning, Arjana Cools,

Thank you for your call, after 1 year and 6 months, I finally get YOU on my voicemail, and on a Friday at 7:30 AM.
The message you left or recorded is completely wrong!!!!

Now to correct this misunderstanding!!!

I want to correct this misunderstanding!!! I'm not filing a complaint against you, as you mentioned on the phone. I do expect a response to the two emails and the registered letter I sent you last year. THAT'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT than what you think!!!!

Your colleague misunderstood the phone message and passed it on. Her respect for patients is lacking... but I've heard she's learning.
Finally, I also heard she's only been working at the ombudsman's office for five months.
You should have more experience and be able to guide patients if you work at the ombudsman's office.
More self-confidence would be a plus, especially for patients when they report a problem to you.
Know your file on this matter and advise professionally... what else is an ombudsman's office for...???

I remain very friendly. Don't dismiss you. There are ombudsmen who do complete their work and you could learn a lesson from them!!!!

After 30 years at UZA, I consulted the ombudsman for the second time last year, 2016. And now I'm getting the door!!!
Your colleague before you had more experience and knew how to treat patients.
Because you're nowhere near that.
Do you think you're MORE experienced than me? We're all the same, regardless of your position.

You can keep emailing me or calling me about this. You'll always get an answer, which was hard to come by in 2016.

Know your file on this and provide professional advice... what else is an ombudsman for...???

Boo Bee,2016,Dutch,"On October 5 at 4:00 PM we had an appointment with Dr. Vermander for an excision on my eye and shoulder.

Until now we have always been with Dr Van Dyck, who always treated us with respect and always informed us very well about what was going to happen and what he was going to do.

This time we had an appointment with Dr Vermander.

When we were called in we were welcomed by 2 nurses, that's what we initially thought because no one had introduced themselves.

From the moment we entered, these 2 ""nurses"" started the procedure in a rather chaotic manner without any explanation of what exactly they were going to do. (later we found out that these 2 ""nurses"" were actually doctors and one of them was Dr Van Hoof) They also didn't tell us anything that they would use a different procedure this time. Because we received no explanation, we assumed that the procedure would be the same as with Dr Van Dyck.

We realized that during this procedure, when it was too late, they used electrocautery. We would never have agreed to the use of this technique on the face, for the high risk of scarring and discoloration, which is what happened. I was also not asked if I was taking blood thinners, which should be done before using this technique.

Also during the procedure, a third person storms in without knocking and without introducing himself while I am lying half naked on the table and the first thing he does is verbally abuse our 4 year old son. This person, who turned out to be Dr Vermander, apparently had a problem with the presence of our son.

If he had a problem with something, he should have addressed us, the parents, and not our son.

At that point we didn't say anything because the other 2 people were doing an excision just above my eye, and after the procedure we were quite shocked at how abrupt Dr. Vermander was towards our son and didn't really realize what had just happened. because everything happened quite quickly. Afterwards we actually realized what had happened.

I myself, who knows a little about this procedure, even had no chance to refuse to use this on my face, but for someone who knows nothing about it, this would have been a very traumatic experience.

I have never been so humiliated and insulted.

Doctors have taken an oath to help and respect people and NOT to act like a superior to the patient.",UZ Antwerpen

I said something about that but Madam lived in her own world and was not at all nice and entertaining. She still has to follow a customer service course (probably a graduated doctor) Anyway the conversation was not pleasant and I couldn't tell much at all while she paid attention and listened. In short a lot of noise and an atmosphere of the 60s. In my opinion. a doctor (whose employer I am!) must put the client at ease and get a good picture of what is going on. friendliness and empathetic thinking are a first requirement.

Some time later I had to report again for a cardiac catheterization.

The cardiac catheterization went smoothly, very experienced and expert, the right injection site was found in one go, without mispuncturing and therefore not burdensome. The reassuring information from the sympathetic nurse was very detailed and clear. The executive cardiologist Dr. Guy Lenders also performed his work very professionally and in a patient-friendly manner, my compliments to this top team.

Hopefully I won't have to go back soon, but if that is the case, I won't dread it like I used to.",UZ Antwerpen
