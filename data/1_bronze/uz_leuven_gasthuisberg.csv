I am writing this review as a deeply concerned parent following a very disappointing and distressing experience at UZ Leuven Gasthuisberg.

On May 20th, 2025, we brought our 14-month-old son to the emergency department. After waiting for over an hour, we were seen by a pediatric ENT specialist, Dr. Julie Van Waterschoot. She attempted to examine my son‚Äôs ear but said she could not see the eardrum due to wax buildup. During the removal process, she caused significant bleeding in his left ear. She explained that it was only a scratch and that the eardrum was not damaged, but as a parent, it was extremely difficult to trust this explanation without clarity or reassurance.

Following this, we experienced further delays and were then informed that our son would undergo a blood test and a CT scan. We were very concerned about the necessity and safety of exposing a 14-month-old to such a procedure, yet we were given little time or information to make an informed decision.

Eventually, a decision was made to surgically insert tubes in both ears by cutting through the eardrums ‚Äî a step that seemed very sudden and aggressive, especially without clear communication or sufficient empathy from the staff. Throughout this experience, I found many of the doctors and nurses unapproachable, unsympathetic, and at times dismissive.

As a parent, you place an enormous amount of trust in a hospital‚Äôs staff when your child is in pain. Unfortunately, that trust was severely damaged by the way this situation was handled ‚Äî both medically and emotionally.

If you really care about your children health, PLEASE CONSIDER NOT TO BRING THEM TO UZ Leuven Gasthuisberg!!!!!!!!!!","Ó£ú","Like","Ó†ç","Share","","","","",""

On the other hand, very bad experience in the hepatology hospitalization department, most of the nurses are limited in their level of care and more particularly the nurse Mike, constantly under stress and because of this provides very poor care and the contact with the patient and family is Zero. He gave my dad pneumonia because of his nervousness, no dialogue with my dad, as if he was already dead, just telling him that he is very ill, as if he wanted to lower his morale.

Also, very bad experience with Dr. Laleman Wim, he is an inhuman and doubtful person. If you are sick, it is better not to have something too serious otherwise it will overwhelm them and they would rather see you die.
Also, the so-called speech therapist in the service, it is better not to have too much rehabilitation work to do because otherwise, you are pushed aside and there is no room for you in their schedule and therefore you can just wait to die.
It's only intensive care where I had a great experience, the rest is total detachment and you are considered to be in the slaughterhouse, you are considered an animal because they don't even speak to you anymore as if you were dead.

I must say, I am very impressed with how the administrative processes are handled, both in the emergency department and as a regular patient. It is quick and easy to find the right departments, and even as an English speaker, you are welcomed in a friendly manner.

I understand that a university hospital is used to train new doctors, which is completely reasonable.

However, what bothers me is that during several appointments, I was only seen by junior doctors. I would have appreciated the opportunity to occasionally see more experienced doctors directly, face-to-face, rather than just having the junior doctor consult them over the phone.

----------------------

Update: Unfortunately, I have to revise my previous review and lower the rating to 2 stars. Several attempts to make appointments have failed, and emails have either gone unanswered or, even worse, been ignored.

The situation mentioned above, involving junior doctors, has led to the point where another hospital is now taking care of me, as I was not satisfied with the treatment I received at UZ Leuven.

I regret having to give this hospital 2 stars because the administrative staff is incredibly efficient, but good administration cannot make up for the quality of treatment I experienced.

----------------------

Update:

Unfortunately, I must now downgrade UZ Leuven to a one-star rating. This is my second negative experience within a few months. Sadly, I have found that highly motivated junior doctors sometimes see ghosts where there are none. One might argue that they simply want to be thorough. However, when this approach ends up making a patient feel worse than they actually are, and when unnecessary and painful procedures are carried out, it has nothing to do with good medical care in my view. I believe it‚Äôs essential for a doctor to know when to stop and not continuously unsettle a patient.","Ó£ú","","Ó†ç","Share","","","","Like","7"

I went to the emergency room twice because of terrible pain in both legs. Sent home twice and ""laughed"" at me, third time I had myself admitted to this hospital because of the terrible pain in my legs. I was in this hospital for a week, and had all kinds of tests, even a spinal tap. Diagnosis was nerve pain and could do nothing about it, did not know where this came from. Only got a lot of medication and that I would have to learn to live with this. As a gym teacher never being able to walk, work and almost only being able to lie in bed because of the pain... what a life... Visited three other hospitals afterwards (Ghent, Genk, Antwerp) all three immediately (my MRI, which was taken in Leuven) diagnosed a tethered cord and split cord. Because of Leuven everything took too long until I could finally be operated on my spinal cord after 9 months of hellish pain and I was finally helped (in Genk). Now I am pill-free. Afterwards the neurosurgeon in Leuven admitted that he did not see that. From only being able to lie in bed and the danger of losing functions, I can now enjoy life again and work as a sports teacher again.","Ó£ú","","Ó†ç","Share","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (Dutch)","Like","5"

After hours they came to see that I have an infection, so I stayed in hospital, eventually sent home with antibiotics and they are not going to treat me because I refuse chemo, I only have lymph nodes where it has spread and they do not want to do any further tests to see if it has spread further. So I was going to get radiation above where there were metastases and then amputation, but I didn't hear anything for 2 months and then yesterday I was spoken to so arrogantly and rudely by an assistant of Professor Friedl Sinnaeve, a young man my age called 'Maurice', that I had the option to be helped several times but I refused, no Maurice, I did not refuse chemo any other treatment. With that attitude and attitude I would better look for another job because you do work with cancer patients, more understanding and empathy would be nicer. Eye rolling, arrogant attitude, ridiculous!
Struggling with my health for 8 years to finally hear that you have 2 cancers in your body, and that you are always treated so poorly and receive poor help, this is truly unbelievable. So much authority, nonsense, forcing me with chemo therapy, putting pressure, scaring, no sense of place/time to give a patient such information about his health.

I decided to visit him because he is known as a reputable doctor, but my experience was nothing short of shocking. He is extremely arrogant and treats his patients as if they are worth less. He doesn't listen to your questions or concerns at all, and it feels like your time means nothing to him. What's even worse is that his work is anything but professional. The outcome of his treatment was disappointing, and when I expressed my concerns, he completely ignored me and acted as if it was my fault. Since he is so famous, I had high expectations, but they were completely dashed. This is not a doctor who cares about his patients or their well-being, but someone who looks at you from on high and seems only interested in money. Save yourself the frustration and find another specialist who treats you with respect and delivers quality.","Ó£ú","","Ó†ç","Share","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (Dutch)","Like","7"

At the registration a tall lady with short black hair and glasses, told me why I came to the Emergency? I showed her my thumb and explain what has happened. She told me I‚Äôve to go to my family doctor. I told her it takes time to have an appointment with my family doctor. She told me here too it takes time. She asked me did I take medication, pain killer, I said non. I want a prescription. I never self medicate myself. She was very rude and I don‚Äôt know what is she doing in a hospital? You never ask a person in pain to go somewhere else? It‚Äôs a very peculiar place in Leuven Belgium to send away patients. I‚Äôve waited 2 h and after all people ahead of me and those after me went to see a doctor, I was always waiting for some help but nothing. I left the emergency very disappointed and with pain.
I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôve call this place? It‚Äôs surely not a hospital and this woman not a nurse.
This a public hospital means it‚Äôs working by the taxpayers money, my taxes and still they treated people less than animals. What a pity.","Ó£ú","","Ó†ç","Share","","","","Like","6"

Fortunately, you can ask for help at the counter so that you can find your way around the hospital. It's easy to get lost in all those hallways. There are also a lot of renovations going on, so it is not easy to find your way easily.

The desk staff are friendly and helpful. But they cannot change much about inaccessible screens (unreadable for the visually impaired).

Debut de la consultation par son collaborator , qui me fait part de la lecture de mon dossier m√©dical et me pose la question , avez-vous encore de l'espoir et qu'attendez vous de nous ?  You are very comfortable with your entrance and mati√®re.   Rapid visit of the professor to understand the medical history and minimize the urinary problems and the subsequent operation and explain the reasons for the problems encountered. The explanation of the explications of the urinary problem, but only the air of the interest.
Consultation termin√©e in 15 minutes.
The consultation report is minimalist, the first diagnosis of the problems of the douleurs and the urinary problems that are not the result of the origin of the urinary equipment but with certain nerves, the final solution for the clinical care of the douleur.
And the reason why you should consult a urologue at the Brussels hospital delta is to use an ultrasound scan and a cystograph to diagnose the urethral stenoses and your stenoses through the lobe prostatique.
It is advisable to ensure that certain medical procedures are taken into account and that the professional and urology of the hospital is the only specialist in the field of quality and the quality of care used by the examiners for diagnosis.
Very disappointed by their practice, which leaves me with a bitter taste and increasingly confirms for me the lack of empathy of certain doctors in this hospital towards the patients.  At the request of my treating physician, I have a private appointment with a professor of urology to ask his opinion and advice and perhaps a solution to my recurring urological flow problems and pain, after the operation of two cysts on the epididymides of the testicles in June 2020 in a other hospital.
Start of the consultation by his colleague, who tells me about reading my medical file and asks me the question: do you still have hope and what do you expect from us?  I am very surprised by this introduction.  Quick visit from the professor to hear my medical history, minimize my urinary problems and pain after my surgery and tell me that I have had health problems for years.  He listened absently to my explanation of my urinary problems, not seeming very interested.
Consultation completed within 15 minutes.
Very minimalist consultation report, according to his diagnosis my pain and urinary problems do not arise from my urinary tract but from certain nerves, the final recommended clinical solution for pain.
Desperate, I consulted a urologist at the Delta Hospital in Brussels, who, after an ultrasound and a cystogram, diagnosed three stenoses in the urethra and a verumontanum stenosis of the prostate lobe.
Good advice: do not trust certain doctors and so-called urology professors in this hospital, who are only very poor quality specialists and are far from taking responsibility for their diagnostic errors.","Ó£ú","","Ó†ç","Share","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (Dutch)","Like","17"

Had an appointment at a certain time, came from far away so was well on time, but they seemed to be busy with some kind of test and people who had put forward their candidacy, and that clearly got priority, probably more income from the pharmaceutical sector. Almost everyone seemed to be a student instead of a nurse. The person who carried out the test was correct but also had to call in the supervisor at a certain point because he was unsure about the actions. Eventually I was able to leave after 3 hours, lost half a day.

The specialist who made the referral cannot continue without a report based on the results, he said on the phone, which is why he referred me instead of in his own hospital, which did not do this. Apparently these weeks can take a while because only 1 or 2 people can interpret it correctly, and they don't have time. When I called for an appointment and they suggested 2 months later, he had already rejected that and emphasized that it was more urgent.

Between waiting weeks for a report and the specialist who only wants to pin an appointment when it is certain that it is there (apparently it can go either way so understandable) so another month easily passed. And in the meantime, pressure from the health insurance company on the patient because everything is dragging on... I would like nothing better than to be able to work again and for the pain to be gone... the family doctor who initially discovered it also warns of the risk of complications and serious matters and finds it unacceptable. I have already had to go via the emergency room twice and I am on an army of painkillers every day with sometimes what seems like internal bleeding...","Ó£ú","","Ó†ç","Share","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (Dutch)","Like","3"

The thing below really happened, there are no untruths in my story and certainly no foul language or indecent behavior.
I needed to get my story out.

April 4th brought into the emergency room by ambulance/mosquito (suicide attempt)
Woke up after 2 days and I don't remember anything about what happened before. (the famous white light at the end of the tunnel)
On 5/04/2022 I was transported to the intensive care unit B.
I would like to thank everyone from the emergency department and the other departments where I stayed during 9 days.
Between 8/04/2022 to 13/04/2022 I was taken to another department (transferred to IAL department)
The doctors there and especially the nurses were super nice to me!!!
In the evening they brought me a pot of coffee (just brought it from her without obligation)
Thank you from the bottom of my heart to all the nurses of IAL and also to the female psychiatrist.
Kind regards, Georges.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On 13/04/2022 we took patient transport to Klina Brasschaat (hospital north of Antwerp).
I was admitted to the Paaz Psychiatry there for 3 weeks.
In the meantime I am back home, on Monday June 13 I have an appointment with the psychologist for further guidance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The cause of all my problems was that I had a gambling addiction, I saw no other way out then (see above in my article)
The first thing I did when I got home was to get myself excluded from the Gaming Commission so that I can no longer gamble online!!
Afterwards I received an email from the national lotto
Their words: ""It's a shame that you are leaving us on E-lotto, but you can still go to the newsagent for scratch cards and lotto/euromillions""
I find it a shame that I receive such messages from a state-owned company like the lotto.
‚Äê---‚Äê-----------------------------------------------------Update: We are already 11/2 months further and things are going in the right direction.
Every week I visit the psychologist and the doctor, I have become less anxious and calmer in my actions.
I know I still have a long way to go, but I have a positive view of the future.
What I have learned is that everyone can be helped, but with the right framework (you have to be open to it) you have already come a long way.

As a long-term patient at the UZ Gasthuisberg in Leuven, it is an hour's drive that I like to make. The hospital exudes impeccable cleanliness and care from the moment you enter.

Interaction with staff is always cordial, although I believe a cheerful attitude on both sides contributes to a pleasant experience. I always try to be the fun one, which can certainly brighten a nurse's day.

The waiting areas and facilities are comfortable and well maintained, making waiting for your turn, an inevitable aspect of any hospital visit, much more bearable.

Over the years I have been treated excellently and well taken care of by the medical staff, something for which I am very grateful.

Although recommending medical facilities can be a sensitive issue due to the inherent risks associated with medical procedures, I would still recommend UZ Gasthuisberg.

However, as I always say, it is important to choose with your gut feeling. Every medical situation is unique and what works for one person may not work for another.

One of the additional advantages of this hospital is the excellent parking facilities, which greatly facilitate access.

Looking back on my experience, I can't really think of anything that needs improvement; it appears to be a well-oiled system that functions efficiently.

The UZ Gasthuisberg in Leuven has proven itself over the years as a reliable medical institution and remains a choice in which I have confidence.","Ó£ú","","Ó†ç","Share","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (Dutch)","Like","3"

VAN DEN BERGHE. In deviation from the protocol, my wife did not get a biopsy, resulting in an incorrect diagnosis and incorrect treatment of her lymph node cancer. Also no follow-up by Dr. ANN JANSSENS, resulting in considerable spread of the tumor in the spleen and liver. Also 3rd degree burns due to the wrong antibiotic. An enormous ordeal and death at the age of 55. Lie after lie afterwards and no sense of guilt while I had a counter-expertise done that demonstrated the mistakes and negligence.
Very poor care and so-called specialists who are not worthy of the title of doctor.
Stay away from there is my appeal.","Ó£ú","","Ó†ç","Share","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (Dutch)","Like","23"

What I must say is that their phone service is very good! They always know what I am talking about and always get to the right service quickly. And that for a very large hospital. Question about hospitalization insurance, question for doctor, everything helped quickly.

What could be improved, in my specific case I received too little information about the operation, how it went and what they did correctly. Kine could tell me more than the doctor.","Ó£ú","","Ó†ç","Share","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (Dutch)","Like","4"

Of course, there are some ups and downs on how nurses would approach you depending on circumstances. My overall experience has been great as nurses were friendly and doctors was great (even there is a time when they do want to sketch out the worse case scenario just so you won't get disappointed if something were to happen).

The hospital has 2 cafeterias to eat, one just nearby the entrances (great sandwitchs, pasteties and other stuffs for good prices) and it closes before 6pm if I am not mistaken. But there are other cafeteria which serves warm food besides salad and other stuffs, that opens til 8pm.

The accessibility of this hospital is good (enough parking spaces and you can also take the buses from the train station, if you want to know the time table, you can find the live status just before the main exits or just go at the bus stop where big board are listed).

Furthermore, they have stores for you to get gifts like flowers, stuffed animals, chocolates, etc. Or vending machines when all of the stores or cafeterias are closed.","Ó£ú","","Ó†ç","Share","","","","Like","3"

I called the allergy department, they then told me that I had to wait until August for a consultation.

Dermatology appointment: doesn't even look at the rash, just prescribes something and says I have to go to allergy.

Easy accessibility, nice infrastructure in the hospital.

Since the arrival of the new outpatient center, many incorrect diagnoses have been made and many incorrect interventions have been performed.
in the outpatient center you can immediately sense the stressful, toxic atmosphere. you already feel that it is no longer the way it used to be.
Nowadays many diseases are also attributed as ""mental"" or you need to ""adjust"" nutrition by a dietician.
while that is never the case.
They can help in easy cases, but when it becomes complex they say ""it's all in your mind"". and there is the door.
the good doctors have not been working in this hospital for a long time and there is a strong spillover between different hospitals.
It's sad to say, but this hospital is no longer like any other and has deteriorated significantly in the field of ""treatments"" and patient care.

Doctors tell me not to act and that it is between my two ears.
this hospital has become rude and no longer follows up on proper treatments at all.
all they want is to be in the spotlight on pubmed/researchgate or some other page where they get ""attention"".
has really become a rude hospital.

With pain in my heart I have to say goodbye to this hospital because they no longer listen to me.
I have been in treatment since 2009 and have always been helped well until the last 3 years it has continued to deteriorate with tests, treatments, interventions, you name it.
I kept getting wrong diagnoses.

It's a general treatment they use to similar patients. My symptoms are back and now I don't even know the evolution of the condition after the treatment.

This is my experience with Gasthuisberg.

‚Ä¢speed

The first time I came from the hospital in Dinant and they accepted me with open hands.
The second time, when I broke my arm again in Leuven, I was welcome again.
They forgot to give me a painkiller the second time because I already looked calm, so if you are in pain be sure to report it, super sweet people, very soothing.
In both cases I had already been operated on the day after, but due to corona it was not possible on the day itself.

‚Ä¢Come back for check ups

This always went very smoothly with their ID scanning system that shows where you need to go
the xrays that I had to do always went very quickly, but then when I go to the doctor I have to wait at least an hour after my appointment time until it is my turn
Once it is my turn, it is always a different doctor than the time before who also has different advice.

‚Ä¢The day operations

It goes very smoothly once you are out of the waiting room less than 20 minutes and you are asleep.

‚Ä¢The doctors, nurses, etc.

Super pleasant people!
I would like to thank them again for their help.
Sometimes they are a bit busy, but the nurses are always there if something comes up.","Ó£ú","","Ó†ç","Share","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (Dutch)","Like","8"

They also give up on their patients very quickly while you are going to a hospital to get help. I also thought that that was the job of doctors, to help people. They are paid by us, damn it. The-gou-tant! If you can, stay away. They will help the easy cases that do not ask too many questions. If it gets a bit more complicated, you will win.

My father stayed here until 13-09-2021, on this date (13-09-2021) a staff member of the UZ Leuven visited my father in the room with the message that my father is not insured and whether he could immediately pay ‚Ç¨4000,-. The lady said that you have to arrange this with your family now, otherwise we cannot help you.

Then my father left today (13-09-2021) at 15:00 because he could not immediately pay the bill. This while my father is indeed insured and also has the highest insurance, which means that everything is reimbursed by the insurer.

My father left here with the knowledge and promise of the staff of this clinic that he would not be helped if he did not pay the bill of ‚Ç¨4000,-. My father stayed here for three days in a shared room.
After speaking to the clinic, they claim that such a bill of that amount is only for a stay of weeks or months.

My father has an inflammation of the liver, pancreas and the 12 finger intestine. My father has to continue taking antibiotics. That is why he went to the Netherlands Rotterdam as soon as possible to continue his treatment.

All in all, my father was treated badly by the staff member who came to hand over the bill. The lady came to inform my father that he is not insured and that he should pay the bill of ‚Ç¨4000,- immediately.

We will take legal action against this illegal and inhumane way of acting.","Ó£ú","","Ó†ç","Share","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (Dutch)","Like","23"

SYMBOLICLY, I WANT TO THANK FROM MY SOUL, (because there are no suitable words to thank these real angels!!!) TO THE ENTIRE STAFF OF THE TEACHER'S TEAM !!!AND THE ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY TEAM! !!
MAY THE LORD GIVE YOU A LONG LIFE TO BE ABLE TO SAVE AS MANY SOULS AS POSSIBLE!!!","Ó£ú","","Ó†ç","Share","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (Romanian)","Like","11"

She had to undergo several tests (the same as a month ago) and we spent 2h30 there with a mask. Until then because of the crowds, but not so obvious for my mother. What really bothered me was the fact that we (my mother, I and a nurse), now in full corona period, were in a small room for the tests, but after 10 minutes another nurse came in with another patient for testing as well. Still during these tests, another lady came in and out of the room 3 to 4 times to get something and when my mother was almost done, another lady came in to take tests, luckily her patient waited outside!! So there were 6 to 7 people in that small room!!!!
Is this possible, while everywhere the use of hand gel, keeping distance and face masks are emphatically pointed out........","Ó£ú","","Ó†ç","Share","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (Dutch)","Like","10"

What's more, it was a reminder even though I had never received my first invoice. I disputed this online, but received an automatic response that it was currently very busy and that it would take a long time before I received an answer.
But recently (months after my message) I received a message that my request for remission had been accepted.
Patience is a virtue.
I am therefore extremely satisfied with the follow-up and administration of this hospital.","Ó£ú","","Ó†ç","Share","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (Dutch)","Like","3"

Their service and administrations are super-friendly, highly organized and have a very user-friendly app that helps you to follow-up your results and check-in to your appointments without going to the counters. Free WiFi is available throughout the buildings.
The medical care is very attentive, proactive(!) and detail oriented. The doctors are aware of the newest technologies/researches etc and can give you an extremely good diagnose and information.

We took him to the emergency room at this hospital for the first time.

After an hour of waiting, the doctor's diagnosis was ""we need to close the wounds with stitches, and then he'll be fine."" The doctor then went back to his computer for 30 minutes without returning.

With parental instinct, we decided to leave and go directly to Brussels to the emergency room at St. Luc Hospital. We were immediately seen by the doctor with his diagnosis: ""When a child is bitten by a dog with open lesions that aren't too deep, never close the wounds with stitches or glue because you'll trap bacteria from the dog's mouth, and it can become infected. So always leave the wounds open and disinfect them with iso-betadine and take antibiotics for 5 days.""

So, in conclusion, I'm not lumping everyone in with the same pile, but was the first doctor professional? We judge what we experienced and are a little shocked.","Ó£ú","","Ó†ç","Share","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (French)","Like","9"

Well, from personal experience I know that this is ABSOLUTELY not the case.
A few years ago I developed chronic pain, and after a while we ended up at the Uz Leuven with hope.
After a waiting period of six months I was finally able to see the specialist, who of course only came in for 5 minutes, and three months later I had to come back.
In the meantime I had an appointment at the orthopedic department for my back.
A doctor came in, together with his male intern.
This doctor treated me so badly that I had to cry, and his intern started crying too, so you can imagine the atmosphere.
The arrogance was dripping off, with all the doctors in Leuven by the way, because they work in `LEUVEN`.
He was arrogant, rude, not an ounce of sympathy...
After three months I had another appointment with the first doctor.
He wasn't there. Suddenly a female doctor comes, who says that they can't do anything and whether I have thought about taking a Dafalgan (!), and otherwise I should go to England for hypnosis.
The interior is also not at all what one expects for the `most modern hospital in Belgium`, but old and worn out, really not even a decent cafeteria.
I thought that doctors became doctors to help people, not to fatten and fatten even more for the UZ Leuven.","Ó£ú","","Ó†ç","Share","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (Dutch)","Like","18"

And now my specialists had referred me to Leuven, they said if anyone can help you, it is her... That is not true at all, I was there for 10 minutes and I will never go back!!! I also didn't see the professor I was supposed to see, I got a different doctor... The doctor said if you wanted to see him as normal, you would have had to wait another year and a half! Scandalous! By the way, they should indicate better in the hospital itself where you need to be.. It took us almost 10 minutes to find the right waiting room.. We had to ask several people, are we in the right place or how should we go.. The nurses etc. but say yes, sorry, it is not well indicated and on the route paper that you receive when registering, it is also not clear and confusing.. I said that they need to change urgently and said they will do it soon!

They dont even provide a translation. I am sure they all know English but they dont want to. This hospital only for Belgian. A health care should be open for all, irrespective of their nationality and skin color. They are neither kind enough nor prepared to assist foreigners.

My wife had been referred by the cardiologist in Turnhout for the placement of a new heart valve. Doctor Nuyens, together with the professor in Leuven, would take care of a new heart valve. I arrived in Leuven by car and was initially shocked by the size of the hospital, but after I had parked my car and had us registered, from that moment on it felt very familiar. After being welcomed from reception to admission by very friendly, knowledgeable staff, as well as by a very caring nurse, Marian was admitted on Sunday evening. On Monday around 13:00 the new heart valve was placed. This procedure did not have to be done with an open heart operation but was done via the groin. The operation was successful and despite the high workload of Dr Nuyens he still took the trouble to call me as his wife immediately to say: the operation was difficult but went very well. After Marian had been in the cardiac monitoring unit for a few hours, she was allowed to return to her room where I visited her that same evening. Once again I was taken care of by the loving nurse, this was not only noticed by me but also by Marian. On Tuesday around 18:00 the doctor came by with the message that all examinations after the operation had been completed and that the result was very satisfactory and he gave her permission to return home.
Personally I think this is a wonderful operation and I would like to express my great appreciation to Dr. Nuyens and his staff as well as certainly the nurse and I am glad that we were given the opportunity to have the operation performed by the UZ hospital in Leuven.
For that my great thanks,

I would like to express my appreciation for the wonderful care I received during my emergency room visit on the evening of March 30.

From the first moment the receptionist was incredibly friendly, empathetic and professional. Despite not speaking the local language, she explained everything to me with patience, a smile and a lot of calm: where to wait, what to do, and she recorded my details with great care and respect. In a stressful situation that was a real relief.

Then I was helped by the gynecologist, and she was just fantastic. She made me feel that I was in good hands: friendly, calm, clear and very attentive. I felt comfortable, heard and respected.

I am a foreign visitor who came here on holiday, and I really leave with a very nice image of this special place. What quality, what dedication, what beautiful humanity there is in this hospital.

If they had taken my complaints seriously in that hospital, I could have been completely healed now instead of being left with a small disability.

By choosing a second opinion, I was literally able to keep my leg. Before the operation, there was no certainty whether my leg could be saved or whether an amputation was necessary. I cannot thank the entire team enough for their approach, from the first contact with the care provider to my discharge. They were always there, even if it was just to get something off your chest.
