The doctors are knowledgeable, but waiting times for a specialist can be long, especially when there's a preference. Treatment is always discussed with the patient as much as possible, unless a dry message is the only option.
At sensitive moments, doctors support patients where they can; performing magic is unfortunately impossible‚Äîeven in a university hospital. Some problems are insoluble, and loss is a part of life.
One potential point for improvement, however, is the registration process. There's room for improvement there. Recently, I wanted to get directions from the machine; I'd just removed my ID. Before I knew it, the machine had swallowed the slip of paper with the directions. Privacy is one thing, but swallowing an important piece of paper after only 10 seconds is too fast. I knew which floor I needed to be on, but the number was a guess. Lost time and late arrival were the result.
I reported the problem, and they said they would ask technical support to extend the time between removing the ID and printing the paper. I have to go back in a few months, so to be continued.","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (Dutch)","Ó£ú","Like","Ó†ç","Share","",""

On Friday evening, July 4, 2025, I arrived at the emergency department of UZA around 7:30 PM with a severe allergic reaction. My skin was swelling, my throat was narrowing and my entire body was covered in red spots. Nevertheless, I was placed in a room, where I had to wait for more than 5 hours before I saw a doctor. (from under a photo of my foot with the spots) this is what my entire body looked like.

When a doctor finally came in, I was told:
‚ÄúWhat do you want us to do about this?‚Äù
A completely inappropriate response, especially for someone who was visibly in trouble. Because I was in shock, I simply replied:
‚ÄúYour job.‚Äù
The doctor then disappeared ‚Äúto look at my file‚Äù and was gone for more than an hour. He came back, took a quick look at the rash on my skin and disappeared again for almost an hour. Around midnight he came back with the message:
""I can't help you if you don't have a fever.""

In the meantime my condition deteriorated: my face felt paralyzed, my lips were swollen and rock hard, and I felt my throat closing up more and more. My friend and I then drove straight to the hospital in Reet (Rivierenland).

The approach there was completely different: within 10 minutes I was given an injection, an IV and I was taken seriously. The doctor there confirmed that my situation was serious and even said that if I had come 10 minutes later, things could have ended much worse.

I am writing this review in the hope that UZA takes this feedback seriously. What I experienced there was downright disappointing and dangerous. I was in a room for 5 hours with an allergic reaction that could have been life-threatening, and received hardly any help. That is not how an emergency room is supposed to work.","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (Dutch)","Ó£ú","Like","Ó†ç","Share","",""

I waited for over half an hour for no reason. When my number was finally called, I was again met by the same staff member who was visibly irritated and completely unprofessional in her attitude. I then went to the radiology department, where I was told that I was late! I had to argue to explain that I had arrived on time, and luckily I still had proof of my first registration with me ‚Äì otherwise I would have missed my appointment due to their poor organisation.

Respect for patients starts at the reception desk, and it is unacceptable that people are treated this way. The organization and attitude of the staff were substandard and unprofessional.

My mother was previously admitted to the C5 department (gastrointestinal diseases), and the nursing there was anything but professional. Whenever I rang the bell for my mother, students kept coming, which is good in itself, but from the moment there was something that the student could not solve, we often had to wait more than an hour before permanent staff arrived. When I called again after 30 minutes (also because I was leaving), the same student came again to help. When I repeated the question, the student apologized and indicated that she was going to ask again. When I walked outside I saw that the permanent staff was in the refectory and that the students were working in the nursing station.  This has happened several times. It is good to have students, but the intention is not for them to take over all the work. If I was lucky enough to speak to someone from the permanent nursing staff, they were often rude. Another time when I came to visit, there was a care going on in the room across the street. Unfortunately I could see and hear everything unwanted because the door was completely open. In addition, there was a finely built nurse who said quite loudly that she hates obese people because she destroys her back on people who don't want to do anything about their weight. I'm not one of the thinnest myself, so it was anything but nice to hear that, let's just keep quiet about how that patient must have felt. During another visit, my mother told me that the nurses had caused her a lot of pain during wound care. I don't know the exact circumstances, but my mother did indicate that the nurse shouted several times that she should not exaggerate. Then the limit was reached for me and I asked at the nursing station to speak to the head nurse. Unfortunately, the head nurse turned out not to be much different. I was allowed to tell my story at the door of the nursing station in front of everyone, instead of having to take myself aside. Every time I said the charge nurse responded defensively and indicated that her team doesn't do those things. After a while I didn't even feel like saying anything anymore.

I was very happy that my mother could return home. She had lost weight and was covered in bruises. We had home care nurses come to care for her further and luckily this went well.

I can only speak well about the doctors. The doctor in the department has also always been helpful to me. The examinations and consultations went perfectly.

My mother told me this department is closing. I have a suspicion why.","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (Dutch)","Ó£ú","","Ó†ç","Share","Like","1"

Normally he would have noticed at one point that the leg was not marked or disinfected, but it still did not instill much confidence...

During the operation, six leg muscle samples were eventually taken, covering at least 10 cm of leg muscle and taking considerable time, whereas I had only been informed of the extraction of one or two muscle samples. As the muscle could not be anesthesised, this caused quite some discomfort.

After the operation, I had to wait for the results of the biopsy until 16.00. During all this time, I received one small bottle of water, a small pack of orange juice and a small industrial Madeleine cookie. No coffee or tea was offered, no breakfast or lunch, whereas I had not been allowed to eat or drink anything since midnight the previous day. As I could not walk, I was not able to get anything from the cafetaria. It would be good if the hospital would at least inform the patients of this Spartan regime before the operation, for instance during the prep-operative call the previous day.

I also wonder why a hospital would offer such unhealthy fare to its patients. Hospitals could contribute to healthier eating habits by setting the right example.

On the positive side, the nurses were friendly and professional, although when I had to urinate in a bed pan, I was not offered any wet (or dry) towels to clean myself afterwards.

All in all, the experience was less reassuring than at UZ Leuven, where one can sense a much more positive and welcoming atmosphere, also amongst the team members of the various teams. Clearly a better-managed hospital!","","","","Ó£ú","","Ó†ç","Share","Like","4"

That was mainly my experience with the ENDOCRINOLOGY department. I could not possibly contact the secretariat. After sending an email in which I asked the endocrinologist for advice regarding my medication, I received (of course) an automatic response in my mailbox, but nothing more. I am still waiting for a response from the doctor. Isn't the patient always entitled to advice?
Finally, I finally got through to the ombudswoman with my dissatisfaction, who actually told me that ""she could not do anything about it because the head of the department (endocrinologist) had told her that the department was understaffed."" Apparently, you can explain all possible abuses with that. A clich√©. The patient is left hungry. I assumed that an ombudsman service always had to defend the patient and not the hospital.

Unfortunately, I have to take the stand regarding the treatment of my father-in-law. He is 87 years old, has been receiving treatment at the UROLOGY department for years. During the last six months he has been in pain and the daughters have to go to the emergency room at the UZA or to the emergency room at the local clinic almost every week. Every time he has to make an appointment at the UROLOGY department, the treating doctor says that they are going to plan a procedure, but these always turn out to be empty promises. Sometimes it is as if people at that service find it annoying that my father-in-law is there again. Why is the situation not clear? If the procedure is no longer possible due to his state of health or advanced age, this should be communicated to my father-in-law and family. But conversations at the Urology department never provide clarity, but some humanity is welcome. After all, no one comes to a clinic for pleasure, not as a patient and not as guidance!
The UZA website states that they are a top clinic, with customer-friendly patient care and groundbreaking!

Extremely unfriendly nurses (apart from 2 nurses and 1 very sweet nurse). I suffered inhumane pain and only saw assistants. I arrived at the emergency room and was given a lumbar puncture with pressure measurement by an assistant who stabbed the wrong number numerous times and asked my mother to assist him (?). Luckily my mom went to get a nurse. After a few hours I got a horrible headache. My meninges were torn, which showed up on the scan the next day because there was a leak in my spinal cord from which cerebrospinal fluid was leaking. According to the assistant neurologist, this was due to my epidural 6 years (!!) ago and was the cause of my pain for which I went to the emergency room in the first place. This was the first diagnosis. The leak was of course the result of the improper puncture performed the day before.

Only after 3 long days was I finally able to go to the pain clinic for a blood patch, which also lasted 2 hours (!) instead of 20 minutes. 2 hours with unbearable pain and that needle in the back because they couldn't find any blood to draw.

When I was discharged I was diagnosed with migraine, which was also a wrong diagnosis as it turned out.
I became temporarily blind a few days after my discharge, but according to the assistant neurologist there was nothing wrong and that I could no longer tolerate my glasses when I was discharged. I have suffered so much unnecessary excruciating pain on top of the pain and condition I was admitted for. I didn't eat for a week, because I couldn't move or sit up and my food was just put next to my bed. I didn't wash for a whole week, because I could supposedly do it myself, even though I couldn't lift my head, let alone my body. I couldn't even go to the toilet and sometimes had to wait 1 hour for a bedpan when I rang the bell.
I had my period so I had to wear a diaper. Inhuman, as if I were in a third world country!! The doctors in the pain clinic were very friendly.

They really work against their will in the neurology department and most of them do not have an ounce of empathy and were sullen and angry. This was even confirmed by the few who do their best there. So it is known internally that it is a hell department.

A few days after my discharge I was admitted to another hospital. They had never seen such two blue arms from an IV there. Every time I was injected in the hospital, this was done very brutally, especially by the large male nurse who walked around there. My IV was leaking so had to be moved every day. This was too much trouble. One night my IV was inserted into the crook of my elbow. I had to sleep with my arm stretched out, because every time I fell asleep the alarm went off and they weren't happy about that.
One time while clearing my IV while administering my medication, the needle popped halfway out of my arm, but the nurse didn't have time so I lay there for over an hour with the blood pouring out of my vein and a needle still half way in.
This was truly a stay in hell!","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (Dutch)","Ó£ú","","Ó†ç","Share","Like","12"

Urology assistant discriminates against you in front of you and your partner about your choice not to have children and refuses you care by
by making up laws, rules, etc. on the spot and openly admitting that he discriminates against you based on age. Second opinions from several experts directly contradicted him.

Once we tested Mr.'s 'legal basis' on the spot, this turned out to be virtually untrue (we suspect that this treatment came from personal conviction) and we were quickly dismissed to prevent worse for him. VITAZ Sint-Niklaas has now helped us enormously with excellent services. I highly recommend hearing there first. In any case, I will never enter Urology at UZA again. EDIT: Dr. Claeys at VITAZ helped me very well and I was even treated twice as quickly as at the UZA, provided they had not discriminated. Karma!

Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed in thinking that the UZA was above such practices.

EDIT: After contact with the ombudsperson, it was made clear that nothing will be done about this in the interest of 'the well-being of the patient' and that a slightly younger man without children (around 25) would be better off being treated for sterilization elsewhere. They kept quiet about lying about non-existent laws and other nonsense, but I'm afraid this is not a coincidence. Even after further feedback that there was a cover-up in this regard, we received a short answer and that was it.

Dear people, you have been warned: AVOID UROLOGY HERE!!! You will be played bingo and a decision will be made *for* you instead of *with* you without taking circumstances into account. You are a number!

I wish the assistant to come and kiss my now sterile cherries. I was helped even faster in Lokeren than in the UZA thanks to his lying practices. 3 weeks faster to be precise. That's called karma.

I did not find this in myhealth app or by post or text message. I called the entire office (but could not get through by phone) to ask what time I should be there. Anyway, I arranged childcare for my kids, notified the teachers, 3 different people in connection with childcare, ... well, Hilde sleep clinic nurse spoke to me incomprehensibly.
I do not recommend this clinic.

Due to the nature of the situation, we prefer to speak in English so we can explain better the problem. All the doctors and nurses were extremely friendly and helpful, we appreciated that a lot. But the receptionist of the emergency area was a very unpleasant woman... we don't know if it had to do with us speaking English or something else but for someone working in the emergency room, where you have to go for something bad, I would expect more empathy. Once we were done, we asked her if there was anything else for us to do, to complete the discharge (this was our first time at the ER). She said in a very sarcastic tone that everything was done and that she will make sure we received the bill for the attention... as if that was the most important thing at the moment!!!

What I have already experienced here:

- A surgeon who claims that my disease will never come back after an immense operation, less than a year later this disease is back. Didn't get any explanation about how or what, the message is just learn to live with it.
- A neurologist who prescribes immunotherapy to young women and does not understand the impact of this and who
the patient completely denies symptoms. Medical gaslighting at its finest. Because of this I cannot get pregnant, I was never told in advance.
- An ophthalmologist who sees you for 2 minutes and doesn't even have the respect to say goodbye properly when leaving.
- An endocrinologist who also made a mistake, admits it and apologizes but then gets angry when you ask for a second opinion.

I will have to wait for the results in the coming days. But it already gives me a good feeling.
I also had to conclude that my doctor; Professor Crosiers, immediately took the bull by the horns and that apparently within a week from my GP to the doctors at the Klina hospital were informed, his first impression and also additional orders had been received.

Now I had polio as a child, which resulted in osteoporosis in the same leg. Now on September 17, 2021 I will be in a wheelchair or walking with crutches and probably for the rest of my life. I still cannot walk or support my knee joint and I have to deal with a lot of pain every day and therefore also serious sleeping problems. I was told by my regular orthopedist that the gamma nail was not the best solution, given the poor condition of my bone, but Doctor N from the UZA insists on having a hip prosthesis. Now I know that if the gamma nail were removed, there is a good chance that my bone will completely crumble; as a result, I will have to have my leg amputated. So if I could go below zero or give no stars I would do so. The UZA used to be an excellent academic hospital with the interests of the patient in mind, now it is just a factory that wants to make the largest possible profits at the expense of the patient and the care is no longer what it should be.","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (Dutch)","Ó£ú","","Ó†ç","Share","Like","20"

When you ask about this, you are told that it may happen that you may not be reimbursed for the extra costs of 65 euros for a single room. They ask if you would like to sign for the room, which appears to state that the specialist's fee may increase by 200%. It is not stated what the operation costs or what the exact increase actually is. You sign in good faith. Afterwards it turns out that you paid 3x the rate and were not reimbursed for 2x, of course.

However, on the day of the transfer, it had been agreed with the d1 department that all dirty laundry would be given away, but not so, I went to the tall beeches specifically to collect the laundry the same day.

The medical staff very attentive and smiling, eager to help. We all understood each other in English.
Cleaning, large salons with wc in salon. The toilet has toilet paper and there are chairs and toilet paper in the lounge area. In the salon there were surgical masks and gloves, a flat water bottle with a disposable cup, disinfectant solution that was actually full. The living room is also equipped with a closet for clothes and a smaller closet with a mini-fridge and a drawer with a code. Soap, I didn't understand why it's not in such conditions, but no...
What seemed strange to me about Romania is the fact that everyone in the hospital is dressed in their home clothes, not pajamas, and what I didn't like at all is the fact that both the medical staff and the admitted patients walk around in outside shoes. In Romania, medical staff and patients wear indoor shoes. Many microbes are brought in from outside.
LG TV in room plus free wifi. All conditions were beyond my expectations.
So yes hospital. I was very satisfied.","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (Romanian)","Ó£ú","","Ó†ç","Share","Like","2"

The day before, still no message with directions to the hospital. Then I called myself and received confirmation that I had to be there at that time via a certain route.  The person who actually made the appointment, Junior, had put my phone number in the wrong box. An hour later I narrowly miss a phone because I am changing my son, I immediately receive a call back and arrive at an exchange that immediately called me back because they did not know who had called. No more phone calls. I leave for my appointment on time and suddenly receive a message that I have to be there half an hour earlier. When I arrived completely stressed, I checked in. The lady at the counter tells me casually that she knew Junior, he often makes mistakes and oh, don't stress because the surgeon is still in the operating room and the first appointment has already been waiting for more than an hour. It is now extremely difficult for me to provide care for my two sons (physically limited) and I have quite a bit of experience with hospitals because of this and I have not experienced this in the last year. Well organized at UZ Leuven and UZ Sint Maarten, on time, clear where you need to be in advance so that you can plan everything with those at home. And if that doctor will be in the operating theater for many hours to come, should he notify the patients so that their appointment can be rescheduled? What a disappointment!
Edit: after an hour an assistant of the doctor came to speak to me, apparently the doctor was not even on the list for consultations and everything went wrong with booking the appointment and the communication from the counter afterwards.

Left our whole family completely broken. Our 10 month baby had a severe rash after wrong advice of a pediatre and didn‚Äôt sleep all night before the MRI. She was crying her heart out and scratching her belly to blood. She was not allowed to eat or drink for 10 hours  before..We had to hold her hands to prevent her from scratching all the way to the hospital. They said pediatre will come but it turned out to be only assistant. She said she has a cream for it and she will make sure it will be put straight after procedure when the baby wakes up. The procedure was 3h late, the doctor has disappeared, none of the nurses informed us what to do. The baby woke up after anaesthesia and started itching like crazy. They said the doctor will come to examine within 30 min max or even faster. Guess what? The doctor never came, her assistant came 2 hours later only with prescription that we already had from before ( the previous doctor promised to put medicine straight away and disappeared forever). On top of that if you ask something they always say how busy they are and how they have a queue of 100 dying babies to make you feel guilty for this while 5 nurses are chatting in the reception. This is complete misguisguidance, horrific time management and false promises. If we knew it would be like that - we wouldn‚Äôt waste 3-4h of time after not sleeping for 24h while our baby is suffering  and will have found a different solution. We were falsely adviced by nurses or the assistant on the phone that doctor is coming any minute throughout 3 h time while baby was hungry and in terrible rush. Nobody checks the baby and said if we can leave or not. With this unskillful time management and lack of organisation it‚Äôs no surprise there is a queue of babies who need help and no time for treat them. All they told me is that if your baby isn‚Äôt dying it‚Äôs ok. At least we could be informed not to waste our time and let our baby suffer, but no one at all seemed to care at route number 10.","","","","Ó£ú","","Ó†ç","Share","Like","9"

Constantly denegrating comments...! If you don't like your current job, please quit instead of spreading your unhapiness on to your patients.
I have sleep deprivation for more than 4 years, which showed in the test results and was sent back home with only a stupid comment that I'm responsible for it myself, when I tried every method there is to get more sleep. You need years of getting a degree at university to call yourself a specialist, but you are unable of fixing a standard sleeping issue...? If you're looking for a solution for your sleeping problem, look further.
Further, this is a facility to get people healthy, maybe offer something healhier to eat than pieces of old bread twice a day and fruit that is beyond fresh. + Worst coffee I drank in my entire life.","","","","Ó£ú","","Ó†ç","Share","Like","11"

I have browsed through the reviews and I notice that many people are not satisfied with their waiting times. For these people I have a reality check.
This is a hospital, not a cash register of the GB where the first in line is also the first to leave. No. This is a hospital, here the rule is that the people who are most in danger of life get priority. So while you are waiting with your hernia or your cold sore, it is possible that the doctors are first busy with the people who have just been brought in by ambulance who have just had a serious car accident. Saving lives. I can imagine that your hernia hurts and your cold sore looks suspicious, but a broken neck and internal bleeding are just a little more urgent.
Give the staff some respect and time, if you press the bell 5 times during an urgent intervention, you may well have to wait even longer because you are forcing a member of staff to come to you.

Moreover, if you start lashing out at a hospital on Google like David Verbelen below, you should really be ashamed of yourself. ""As CEO of one of the largest companies in Belgium. Sir, you are an independent florist...

If you really want to lash out at the hospital, I can advise you to do this directly at the UZA itself, to their ombudsman or the complaints department. (Yes, they have them there!) Google reviews will not solve this for you.","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (Dutch)","Ó£ú","","Ó†ç","Share","Like","17"

The UZA was a disaster, I had been to the anesthesia in advance for a pre-op interview a week before the operation, and I was also told there again to be on time, 6:30 in the morning, because my operation was supposedly one of the first on the list. Day of the operation, my partner took 2 days off to be able to feed me and help me a bit. First I had to wait an hour before we were allowed to go to the room, then without any news (I had to remain sober the entire time) I had to wait until 15:30 in the afternoon for an operation that was scheduled for the morning. And now the worst: DR A comes to tell me that DR B cannot be present and that the operation should therefore be postponed to another date. Very angry, especially because of the total lack of communication! None of the nurses knew anything, every time I asked when it would be my turn (my partner still had to go and get her daughter) I got the answer that I insist and that I just have to be patient.

This leads to frustration for the doctor or head in question. They are unable to resolve the issues, which destroys the relationship between doctor and patient, and the patient ultimately leaves the hospital with negative experiences and never returns.
Positive points: Staff treats patients as they should be.
Improvement points: Department heads, etc. Respect for patients is lacking.

Good morning, Arjana Cools,

Thank you for your call, after 1 year and 6 months, I finally get YOU on my voicemail, and on a Friday at 7:30 AM.
The message you left or recorded is completely wrong!!!!

Now to correct this misunderstanding!!!

I want to correct this misunderstanding!!! I'm not filing a complaint against you, as you mentioned on the phone. I do expect a response to the two emails and the registered letter I sent you last year. THAT'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT than what you think!!!!

Your colleague misunderstood the phone message and passed it on. Her respect for patients is lacking... but I've heard she's learning.
Finally, I also heard she's only been working at the ombudsman's office for five months.
You should have more experience and be able to guide patients if you work at the ombudsman's office.
More self-confidence would be a plus, especially for patients when they report a problem to you.
Know your file on this matter and advise professionally... what else is an ombudsman's office for...???

I remain very friendly. Don't dismiss you. There are ombudsmen who do complete their work and you could learn a lesson from them!!!!

After 30 years at UZA, I consulted the ombudsman for the second time last year, 2016. And now I'm getting the door!!!
Your colleague before you had more experience and knew how to treat patients.
Because you're nowhere near that.
Do you think you're MORE experienced than me? We're all the same, regardless of your position.

You can keep emailing me or calling me about this. You'll always get an answer, which was hard to come by in 2016.

Know your file on this and provide professional advice... what else is an ombudsman for...???

I'd say, put yourself in my shoes. How would you react if you were treated like that...???","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (Dutch)","Ó£ú","","Ó†ç","Share","Like","10"

Until now we have always been with Dr Van Dyck, who always treated us with respect and always informed us very well about what was going to happen and what he was going to do.

This time we had an appointment with Dr Vermander.

When we were called in we were welcomed by 2 nurses, that's what we initially thought because no one had introduced themselves.

From the moment we entered, these 2 ""nurses"" started the procedure in a rather chaotic manner without any explanation of what exactly they were going to do. (later we found out that these 2 ""nurses"" were actually doctors and one of them was Dr Van Hoof) They also didn't tell us anything that they would use a different procedure this time. Because we received no explanation, we assumed that the procedure would be the same as with Dr Van Dyck.

We realized that during this procedure, when it was too late, they used electrocautery. We would never have agreed to the use of this technique on the face, for the high risk of scarring and discoloration, which is what happened. I was also not asked if I was taking blood thinners, which should be done before using this technique.

Also during the procedure, a third person storms in without knocking and without introducing himself while I am lying half naked on the table and the first thing he does is verbally abuse our 4 year old son. This person, who turned out to be Dr Vermander, apparently had a problem with the presence of our son.

If he had a problem with something, he should have addressed us, the parents, and not our son.

At that point we didn't say anything because the other 2 people were doing an excision just above my eye, and after the procedure we were quite shocked at how abrupt Dr. Vermander was towards our son and didn't really realize what had just happened. because everything happened quite quickly. Afterwards we actually realized what had happened.

I myself, who knows a little about this procedure, even had no chance to refuse to use this on my face, but for someone who knows nothing about it, this would have been a very traumatic experience.

I have never been so humiliated and insulted.

Doctors have taken an oath to help and respect people and NOT to act like a superior to the patient.","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (Dutch)","Ó£ú","","Ó†ç","Share","Like","11"

Have been there often with my daughter now twelve years, and will still come. The trust is very big, and have already swum through some waters with my daughter so keep it up x
My daughter still often. I have always had good confidence in it.","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (Dutch)","Ó£ú","","Ó†ç","Share","Like","2"

She received me in her room and asked if the room door could be left open!!!! It was very warm in the hospital (as always and I had experience with that elsewhere) She looked excited and I said something to her but didn't answer, when I made a comment about it she was very irritated, she wanted to go to the ""concentration"" and asked quite unfriendly, authoritarian and arrogant a number of questions, when I wanted to answer and explain that for the first time as a patient she interrupted me every time. I said something about that but Madam lived in her own world and was not at all nice and entertaining. She still has to follow a customer service course (probably a graduated doctor) Anyway the conversation was not pleasant and I couldn't tell much at all while she paid attention and listened. In short a lot of noise and an atmosphere of the 60s. In my opinion. a doctor (whose employer I am!) must put the client at ease and get a good picture of what is going on. friendliness and empathetic thinking are a first requirement. In addition, she is also a staff member, I read!!! I myself have worked in business for 45 years and I have had many conversations, but I have never encountered it this bad. I told her that too. She probably does not tolerate contradiction. I will NEVER go back.","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (Dutch)","Ó£ú","","Ó†ç","Share","Like","6"

But if you do need to have a 3D CT scan made, for example, the first thing you will notice is the friendliness of the hospital staff. In my case, this applies from check-in to taking the photos.
The route you have to follow to the relevant department is very comfortable, no more searching, you end up in the right place in one go, that is a super solution, my compliments to whoever came up with this.
Some time later I had to report again for a cardiac catheterization.
Once again I experienced the reassuring atmosphere with both the nurses and the doctors.
It was so pleasantly relaxing that there was even a joke in between.
Look, I don't know who brought this positive atmosphere to this excellent hospital, but it can be an example for our society.
The cardiac catheterization went smoothly, very experienced and expert, the right injection site was found in one go, without mispuncturing and therefore not burdensome. The reassuring information from the sympathetic nurse was very detailed and clear. The executive cardiologist Dr. Guy Lenders also performed his work very professionally and in a patient-friendly manner, my compliments to this top team.

Hopefully I won't have to go back soon, but if that is the case, I won't dread it like I used to.","Translated by Google","„Éª","See original (Dutch)","Ó£ú","","Ó†ç","Share","Like","1"
