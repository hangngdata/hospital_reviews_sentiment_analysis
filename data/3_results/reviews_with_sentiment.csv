Divine Nkasia,2025-06,French,"[EN] Bad experience at the UZ Brussels Emergency Room

On May 27th, around noon, I went to the UZ Brussels Emergency Room due to very intense intestinal pain, to the point where I could barely walk. The situation was extremely difficult, both physically and emotionally.

After the administrative formalities, I was treated by a young man who showed no professionalism. I, as the patient, had to ""guide"" him, which was completely unacceptable. He then disappeared without explanation, leaving me alone for 50 minutes in an examination room, without any communication or follow-up.

I could hear the emergency room doctors talking in the hallway while I stood there, helpless. I finally spoke to them myself to let them know I had been there for an hour. It was only then that an emergency room doctor came in and concluded, without any real examination, that I ""wasn't sick."" No blood test was performed, even though this is a fundamental basic examination in this type of situation. I wasted nearly four hours for nothing.

I finally went to another hospital, Brugmann Hospital, where I immediately had a blood test, a urine test, and an X-ray. It turned out that my intestines were obstructed and my blood showed a clearly elevated inflammatory level. UZ Brussels completely abandoned me. They didn't even provide basic medical care; a simple blood test, which is essential in emergencies, wasn't even performed.

Poor communication, a lack of professionalism, and a passive attitude seem to be the norm there. An emergency department like the one at UZ Brussels should be ashamed of providing such deplorable care. No concrete action has been taken. I was literally told that ""if we had to take a blood test from everyone, it wouldn't be feasible"" and that I ""didn't look sick."" Who are you to judge a person's health based solely on their appearance? If I come to the emergency room, it's for a serious reason.

Bullet,2025-06,Dutch,"One star is too many. Our 8-year-old son had an appointment for his circumcision at 12:00 noon. Because the procedure is performed under general anesthesia, he was not allowed to eat anything from 7:00 in the morning and drink until 11:30 (with only a little until 10:00, to be safe). He did not go into the operating room for the anesthesia until 17:00. It unnecessarily made our child suffer for five more hours without food and drink, which is unacceptable.

Why make an appointment at 12:00, if he has to wait so long? We were finally allowed to go home around 22:00, without a pediatrician to advise us or a certificate of absence from school. We were not given help to get to the exit and had to climb the stairs with a fresh wound on his genitals — which is downright barbaric.

The nurse advised us to go to the emergency room to get a certificate for school and to get additional information about the treatment. After the hurdles of getting there, we were told that I had to register again for a consultation in the emergency room, which would mean another two hours of waiting. I explained that we had been in the hospital since 11:30, that my son still had a wound and that the staff was not doing anything about it. They laughed at us and refused to call a pediatrician for us alone.

Exhausted, irritated and with my son just out of anesthesia, we left for home without any help. This was especially frustrating because our vehicle was at the pediatric ward, where we had to register. On the street, on foot, because all other exits were closed after 22:00, we had to walk to our vehicle with a bloody wound in the genitals — an absurd situation.

Romane Habran,2025-05,French,"After two visits to the emergency departments of two other hospitals, the UZ emergencies (finally) took care of me!

Huge ear infection (see photos: D1 and D5 - hospital discharge) following a new piercing, and already on antibiotics for 6 days, with no improvement, quite the contrary!

I was directly in contact with an ENT who decided to make an incision to remove the infection which had been stored for days (a good week)! - Medical procedure already requested 3 days earlier in another hospital which refused it to me because supposedly “we never make an incision or puncture in an ear”! -

Unfortunately for me, the infection had already gone down into the blood so I had to be hospitalized. I had the opportunity to see the ENT in question every morning of my hospitalization, with clear follow-up (the doctor knows the situation), without passing through the hands of various ENTs.

The nurses were gentle and attentive, always worried about whether I had everything I needed. The ENT was always very clear in his explanations and medical actions towards me.

The food was good, the shower water hot, the room cleaned daily, the bed made again every morning, etc.

The decision was always made in my presence: the explanation of why I was kept for another day, and on the day of my release, the ENT was very attentive to my desire to leave, and given the improvement in my situation, accepted my release. I found it very appreciable!

Living in the Liège region, UZ is far from home, but if I had to go back there, I would without hesitation.

Little advice: the doctor should also look at the end of the day at the results of the various examinations carried out during the day (blood test, smears, etc.) to put in place the ad hoc solution to the health problem as quickly as possible (e.g. targeted bacteria - appropriate antibiotic requested - first dose by the patient in the evening and not just the next afternoon).",UZ Brussel,"after two visits to the emergency departments of two other hospitals, the uz emergencies (finally) took care of me!

Unfortunately, we were confronted with behavior that I consider unacceptable from some nurses.

Later, during a blood test, I fainted. Here again, the nurse's attitude was completely inappropriate. He said to me: ""Oh madam, stop acting like this, come on!"" These words were unbearably cruel, especially at a time when I felt particularly vulnerable.

A hospital should be a place of listening, humanity, and compassionate care. Unfortunately, what I experienced here was the complete opposite. Blatant disregard for patients, an alarming lack of professionalism, and a total lack of empathy.

Today was a good example of this:

After 6 weeks in a cast, it would be removed tomorrow at the orthopedics department, unfortunately I took a positive corona test yesterday. That's why I decided to call to ask if I'm still welcome (with a face mask).

Halfway through my sentence I got a very blunt answer; ""Then I might as well not have asked, sir, I won't let you come tomorrow.""

You should know that a session costs almost €600. We contacted the billing department who did not want to hear anything; as well as the mediation department, which was otherwise very understanding. I had mentioned to them that I would pay if I got the appointments for the follow-up, and they found her two appointments on the same day this summer (one at 11 a.m. and one at 4 p.m.; convenient!), even though the dermatologist had stipulated not to do laser treatment during the summer.

suddenly emails with new appointments without asking if this is ok or if the patient can, unilaterally recorded, a month later when the treating physician considers it urgent.

We paid every time we went there. They send invoices that have already been paid. I called them to explain their mistake, they admitted the error.

SABATINO TERRACCIANO,2021-07,French,"What a scandalous post-operative follow-up...
Coronography and cardiac angioplasty (insertion of two stents) in mid-October...
The first surgery didn't produce the same results in the operating room as the CT scan and resulted in a stay of operation, followed by a second surgery 15 days later.
Following this surgery, I had to take mandatory medication to thin the blood and regulate my blood pressure.
After taking an initial blood pressure medication that caused significant side effects, the cardiologist (Doctor Soens) prescribed an equivalent medication that unfortunately caused even more side effects, including irregular heartbeat, chest pain, dizziness, etc.

A post-operative appointment was scheduled for November 9th, but was ultimately canceled by the UZ. So I sent an email to the cardiologist with a reminder the next day and a request to forward my email to the cardiology secretary on the third and fourth days to inform them of my poor and worrying condition. WITHOUT ANY REACTION!

This cardiologist, who is supposed to monitor you pre- and post-op, finally allowed herself to contact me via WhatsApp after four days (because she doesn't answer the phone or emails) and wrote to me today:

After explaining to him that she had had a small injury near her wrist a week earlier, the arm had become very painful since the beginning of the evening. (We are dealing with a problem of lymphedema of the lower limbs, which my partner made clear to him).

Faced with this more than doubtful diagnosis and the increase in pain, she went to see her doctor today. He directly found the reason for the condition: lymphangitis.
The emergency blood test revealed a bacterial streptococcal infection which had entered lymphedema through the wound.
Fortunately the infection has not yet passed into the circulatory system, which could have led to sepsis.

Eva Xia,2019-07,English,"They left a patient (my dad) who can't move (arms and legs) in front of my door. It's cold and snowing today!!!!!!!!!

Today my dad can leave this hospital after a week stay. The social worker (her name is ELS) ordered a taxi for my dad that will arrive at the hospital between 13 and 15 o'clock to pick him up. We arrived at the hospital around 13 o'clock and the nurses told us that my dad left 20 min ago (12h40)????!!!!

We called the social worker to inform why my dad left 20 min earlier than expected and agreed. She wasn't aware so she called the taximan and tells us that the taximan will wait.

Soon later i received a call from an unknown number with my dad's voice telling us the taximan just left. he was alone in front of the door!!!

So i called the social worker again that this is not acceptable. She told me she can't do anything and she assumed that we are home to welcome him. Let's make this more clear.
She finds it logic that when someone ordered a taxi for a patient to leave the hospital that the family will be home!!!!!!!!
She never asked us about this!!!!!
She told us this and said she can't do anything. Sorry but there are plenty of ways to help this.
e.g. by calling the driver again and tell him to stay or or or....
She seemed not to be aware that leaving a patient who can't move in front of a door is NOT OK!! especially with the weather condition of today!!!

Luckily a neighbour saw my dad there alone and watched over him. I didn't know my neighbourhood. We are new people arriving there in the area.

After a couple of calls with the social worker i suggested that it's better not to assume (without asking) that the family will be home to pick up the patient. Instead of being sorry for it she told me: it's better not to order a taxi the same day of leaving the hospital... WHAT?!!

I'm really disappointed in the service and the irresponsibility that this social worker Els provided/showed us and

IT'S NOT OK TO:
1 ordered a taxi but not being aware that the taxi came earlier
2 letting the patient (who can't move ) leaving the hospital with a taxi man without any confirmation of the family
3 for assuming that the family will be home
4 Leaving a patient who can't move alone at the destination
5 not even sorry about the situation and putting the responsibility away

I will NEVER order a transport with this service of this hospital. It's pitty that such a good hospital with excellent medical care and doctors has such a irresponsible social worker.

I know that probably the service of complaint won't even read my complain.

But I sincerely hope nobody's dad, mom or children will ever be in this situation. Especially in the medical world where responsibilities have such a big impact.

Teddy cool,2025-06,English,"I am Very Disappointed with the Care at UZ Leuven Gasthuisberg – Pediatric and ENT Departments

I am writing this review as a deeply concerned parent following a very disappointing and distressing experience at UZ Leuven Gasthuisberg.

On May 20th, 2025, we brought our 14-month-old son to the emergency department. After waiting for over an hour, we were seen by a pediatric ENT specialist, Dr. Julie Van Waterschoot. She attempted to examine my son’s ear but said she could not see the eardrum due to wax buildup. During the removal process, she caused significant bleeding in his left ear. She explained that it was only a scratch and that the eardrum was not damaged, but as a parent, it was extremely difficult to trust this explanation without clarity or reassurance.

Following this, we experienced further delays and were then informed that our son would undergo a blood test and a CT scan. We were very concerned about the necessity and safety of exposing a 14-month-old to such a procedure, yet we were given little time or information to make an informed decision.

Eventually, a decision was made to surgically insert tubes in both ears by cutting through the eardrums — a step that seemed very sudden and aggressive, especially without clear communication or sufficient empathy from the staff. Throughout this experience, I found many of the doctors and nurses unapproachable, unsympathetic, and at times dismissive.

As a parent, you place an enormous amount of trust in a hospital’s staff when your child is in pain. Unfortunately, that trust was severely damaged by the way this situation was handled — both medically and emotionally.

If you really care about your children health, PLEASE CONSIDER NOT TO BRING THEM TO UZ Leuven Gasthuisberg!!!!!!!!!!",UZ Leuven Gasthuisberg,"i am very disappointed with the care at uz leuven gasthuisberg – pediatric and ent departments

Surfer Paradise (SurferParadise.de),2025-03,English,"I recently visited one of Belgium's largest university hospitals, and overall, my experience was quite mixed. I must say, I am very impressed with how the administrative processes are handled, both in the emergency department and as a regular patient. It is quick and easy to find the right departments, and even as an English speaker, you are welcomed in a friendly manner.

I understand that a university hospital is used to train new doctors, which is completely reasonable.

However, what bothers me is that during several appointments, I was only seen by junior doctors. I would have appreciated the opportunity to occasionally see more experienced doctors directly, face-to-face, rather than just having the junior doctor consult them over the phone.

----------------------

Update: Unfortunately, I have to revise my previous review and lower the rating to 2 stars. Several attempts to make appointments have failed, and emails have either gone unanswered or, even worse, been ignored.

The situation mentioned above, involving junior doctors, has led to the point where another hospital is now taking care of me, as I was not satisfied with the treatment I received at UZ Leuven.

I regret having to give this hospital 2 stars because the administrative staff is incredibly efficient, but good administration cannot make up for the quality of treatment I experienced.

----------------------

Update:

Unfortunately, I must now downgrade UZ Leuven to a one-star rating. This is my second negative experience within a few months. Sadly, I have found that highly motivated junior doctors sometimes see ghosts where there are none. One might argue that they simply want to be thorough. However, when this approach ends up making a patient feel worse than they actually are, and when unnecessary and painful procedures are carried out, it has nothing to do with good medical care in my view. I believe it’s essential for a doctor to know when to stop and not continuously unsettle a patient.",UZ Leuven Gasthuisberg,"i recently visited one of belgium's largest university hospitals, and overall, my experience was quite mixed. i must say, i am very impressed with how the administrative processes are handled, both in the emergency department and as a regular patient. it is quick and easy to find the right departments, and even as an english speaker, you are welcomed in a friendly manner.

i understand that a university hospital is used to train new doctors, which is completely reasonable.

however, what bothers me is that during several appointments, i was only seen by junior doctors. i would have appreciated the opportunity to occasionally see more experienced doctors directly, face-to-face, rather than just having the junior doctor consult them over the phone.

--

update: unfortunately, i have to revise my previous review and lower the rating to 2 stars. several attempts to make appointments have failed, and emails have either gone unanswered or, even worse, been ignored.

the situation mentioned above, involving junior doctors, has led to the point where another hospital is now taking care of me, as i was not satisfied with the treatment i received at uz leuven.

i regret having to give this hospital 2 stars because the administrative staff is incredibly efficient, but good administration cannot make up for the quality of treatment i experienced.

The thing below really happened, there are no untruths in my story and certainly no foul language or indecent behavior.
I needed to get my story out.

April 4th brought into the emergency room by ambulance/mosquito (suicide attempt)
Woke up after 2 days and I don't remember anything about what happened before. (the famous white light at the end of the tunnel)
On 5/04/2022 I was transported to the intensive care unit B.
I would like to thank everyone from the emergency department and the other departments where I stayed during 9 days.
Between 8/04/2022 to 13/04/2022 I was taken to another department (transferred to IAL department)
The doctors there and especially the nurses were super nice to me!!!
In the evening they brought me a pot of coffee (just brought it from her without obligation)
Thank you from the bottom of my heart to all the nurses of IAL and also to the female psychiatrist.
Kind regards, Georges.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On 13/04/2022 we took patient transport to Klina Brasschaat (hospital north of Antwerp).
I was admitted to the Paaz Psychiatry there for 3 weeks.
In the meantime I am back home, on Monday June 13 I have an appointment with the psychologist for further guidance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The cause of all my problems was that I had a gambling addiction, I saw no other way out then (see above in my article)
The first thing I did when I got home was to get myself excluded from the Gaming Commission so that I can no longer gamble online!!
Afterwards I received an email from the national lotto
Their words: ""It's a shame that you are leaving us on E-lotto, but you can still go to the newsagent for scratch cards and lotto/euromillions""
I find it a shame that I receive such messages from a state-owned company like the lotto.
‐---‐-----------------------------------------------------Update: We are already 11/2 months further and things are going in the right direction.
Every week I visit the psychologist and the doctor, I have become less anxious and calmer in my actions.
I know I still have a long way to go, but I have a positive view of the future.
What I have learned is that everyone can be helped, but with the right framework (you have to be open to it) you have already come a long way.

As a long-term patient at the UZ Gasthuisberg in Leuven, it is an hour's drive that I like to make. The hospital exudes impeccable cleanliness and care from the moment you enter.

Interaction with staff is always cordial, although I believe a cheerful attitude on both sides contributes to a pleasant experience. I always try to be the fun one, which can certainly brighten a nurse's day.

The waiting areas and facilities are comfortable and well maintained, making waiting for your turn, an inevitable aspect of any hospital visit, much more bearable.

Over the years I have been treated excellently and well taken care of by the medical staff, something for which I am very grateful.

Although recommending medical facilities can be a sensitive issue due to the inherent risks associated with medical procedures, I would still recommend UZ Gasthuisberg.

However, as I always say, it is important to choose with your gut feeling. Every medical situation is unique and what works for one person may not work for another.

One of the additional advantages of this hospital is the excellent parking facilities, which greatly facilitate access.

Dennis Verstralen,2025-04,Dutch,"Last Monday I visited the UZ Hospital in Leuven for the first time with my wife. My wife had been referred by the cardiologist in Turnhout for the placement of a new heart valve. Doctor Nuyens, together with the professor in Leuven, would take care of a new heart valve. I arrived in Leuven by car and was initially shocked by the size of the hospital, but after I had parked my car and had us registered, from that moment on it felt very familiar. After being welcomed from reception to admission by very friendly, knowledgeable staff, as well as by a very caring nurse, Marian was admitted on Sunday evening. On Monday around 13:00 the new heart valve was placed. This procedure did not have to be done with an open heart operation but was done via the groin. The operation was successful and despite the high workload of Dr Nuyens he still took the trouble to call me as his wife immediately to say: the operation was difficult but went very well. After Marian had been in the cardiac monitoring unit for a few hours, she was allowed to return to her room where I visited her that same evening. Once again I was taken care of by the loving nurse, this was not only noticed by me but also by Marian. On Tuesday around 18:00 the doctor came by with the message that all examinations after the operation had been completed and that the result was very satisfactory and he gave her permission to return home.
Personally I think this is a wonderful operation and I would like to express my great appreciation to Dr. Nuyens and his staff as well as certainly the nurse and I am glad that we were given the opportunity to have the operation performed by the UZ hospital in Leuven.
For that my great thanks,

J S DC,2025-06,Dutch,"My trajectory at UZ Gent started when I was 12 years old, for guidance on gender dysphoria. Unfortunately, this has developed into one of the worst experiences of my life. The follow-up was substandard from the start: from child psychologist to plastic surgery.

My future wish to have children was never taken into account. Prof. Monstrey followed me further within plastic surgery - a decision that I now consider to be the biggest mistake of my life. The communication was downright bad. The operation was eventually performed by a student under his supervision, and this went wrong. Numerous complications followed, and the urology team was completely ignored, resulting in even more problems on the urological level.

I was later promised corrections by the plastic team, once everything had healed. But those promises were not kept. I did not receive proper aftercare, which has now left me with trauma. Despite my fear, I returned to the plastic surgery department, with an appointment with Prof. Buncamper. He refused any form of correction, although this had been promised earlier. Instead, I received a card from a tattoo artist who could tattoo “realistically”. I could clearly see from the photos that it was a belly flap – when I mentioned this, I was immediately dismissed without explanation.

My attempts to seek help again always ended in disappointment. Even with the lymphatic doctor: my hand has been swollen for 10 years after the operation, but the doctor did not look at me and simply sent me away again. Once again I had gathered courage and made time – for nothing.

The treatment for nerve pain on the scars (via fat injections) also had no effect.

Subsequently, the ombudsman service also did not provide proper assistance. I am not in the habit of writing negative reviews (feel free to check my profile), but I see no other option than to warn others about this experience. For irregular and unexplained pain in my right ear, I made an appointment online at the ENT department and I was given an appointment with the doctor in question quickly. I was welcomed coldly, with hardly any contact being made and the gentleman mainly looked at his computer screen. Apparently my medical file was being looked at on Cozo all the time and this doctor opened a total of 11 documents (my own GP has never opened so many documents on this platform). He didn't actually listen to my story, but formed a picture based on all these documents. This includes an overview of the medications I took in the past. He asked me what medication I took and I answered honestly that I sometimes took some painkillers or anti-inflammatories. But he did not believe this because of my medication schedule that was open on the screen (which I could not see, it was set up that way). He forgot that there was also an end date for this medication. When he asked what medication I was taking, he did not accept my answer, but assumed that I was still taking all the medication listed. Apparently he could not or did not want to read that these were no longer taken and did not believe me. At this point he became verbally aggressive, his attitude became intimidating and I was basically humiliated. I was no longer believed in my story because of the tests that could not show anything and my medical past. A consultation five years earlier in another hospital was dragged into this whole and used against me. It was suggested (not literally said) by the man who calls himself a doctor that I had other problems. Since I didn't say what medication I was taking (which I did), he claimed I was acting like the medical expert in the room. This situation got completely out of hand. He came across as non-verbally deceptive because of his posture, his wide eyes, the gestures with his arms and his choice of words. I felt completely intimidated and unhelped. I also had the impression that he did not fully understand me, Dutch is clearly not his first language. When I talked about physical problems he clearly understood them as psychological ones. I was then virtually forced out of the practice without any prospects of help or treatment. At the end he literally said that the hospital services could learn from this experience by not taking someone in faster than me. I have no idea what I did to deserve this insult. I brought this entire story to the ombudsman service, but they could not tell me anything other than that they had forwarded the story to the doctor by email, but he did not respond.

Fortunately, we have never had to rely on care for this. OEF

Medication is placed on the breakfast and lunch table during the weekend and you can go behind it without hesitation while everyone is having breakfast (privacy??)

Understand who can understand
but the head nurse DIna really needs a refresher; How do you deal with people who are vulnerable, she approaches you to explain the weekend arrangements but you don't even know who she is? Oh my goodness, all those vulnerable people...you should be ashamed!
Do something about it!
I also work in healthcare myself, but I can't imagine treating people like this.

that's basic care, after all, when you introduce yourself to a patient!

i spent 2 weeks in the anxiety and depression department because i fell into depression due to the death of my mother.
it did not help me, on the contrary, i became afraid of healthcare.
a disappointment in nursing staff
fortunately, we have never had to rely on care for this. oef

medication is placed on the breakfast and lunch table during the weekend and you can go behind it without hesitation while everyone is having breakfast (privacy??)

understand who can understand
but the head nurse dina really needs a refresher; how do you deal with people who are vulnerable, she approaches you to explain the weekend arrangements but you don't even know who she is? oh my goodness, all those vulnerable people..you should be ashamed!
do something about it!
i also work in healthcare myself, but i can't imagine treating people like this.

and you have to pluck up the courage to ask for some support?
still important in an anxiety and depression department? basic care for me.

customized care does not correspond to reality,

no individual care as described in the brochure.

Lukas,2024-10,Dutch,"Dear

Last week my father spent three days in rehabilitation at the Ghent University Hospital after a knee prosthesis. Due to a shortage of places in the rehabilitation department, he was placed in another department. The care, and especially the pain management, was substandard.

(I am an emergency and intensive care nurse myself, and my father is a judge. I mention our professions explicitly because it seems as if some nurses are quick to make judgments and think that patients are exaggerating or seeking attention,...
My father was not taken seriously.)

1. Pain management and poor follow-up

The nurses' primary goal was to control my father's pain, but that didn't happen. He did not sleep a wink during his stay due to the enormous pain. This despite the fact that the attending physician had prescribed Oxynorm on the first day for use if necessary during his stay. My father was given this medication only once.
Why was receiving Oxynorm an absolute 'no-go' for the nurses, while this was explicitly allowed by the doctor?

In addition, my father was entitled to a new ice pack every two hours (at 2 a.m. and 4 a.m.), as it gets warm and is therefore no longer effective. However, he never received this during the night, even after he explicitly requested it from the night nurse, who replied bluntly: ""No, we're not going to do that, no time.""

2. Inconsistent policies regarding medication

The explanation my father received about his pain management differed per nurse. So many didn't seem to know that he could receive Oxynorm? Every request regarding this medication was always refused.
There was also a lot of confusion about whether or not to administer diclofenac. Some nurses refused to give this because of his hypertension, while others indicated that it was possible. The reason they gave for not giving it was because diclofenac can increase blood pressure, but this increase is minimal. In that case, why wasn't his blood pressure simply checked, instead of withholding this medication for no apparent reason?

In the end, my father only received paracetamol per os and very occasionally diclofenac, supplemented with an ice pack every now and then. This was completely inadequate considering the intensity of his pain, which was barely evaluated.

3. Neglect of other patients

Besides my father, there was another patient who was immobile. At one point this man urgently needed to urinate, but no urine bottle was provided. My mother reported this to a nurse who was at the computer, but she indicated that she had ""no time"" to help. My mother had to ask where the urine bottle was located so that she could give it to the patient. Unfortunately it was already too late; the patient had wet his bed. This could easily have been prevented with a little attention and care.

Conclusion

The care provided during my father's stay was far below standard. The lack of adequate pain control, ignoring doctor's orders, conflicting information about medication and the lack of basic care for other patients are not only worrying, but also unacceptable.

I am ashamed of how the nurses treated my father. This type of negligence and lack of care gives our profession a bad name.
Hopefully not all patients are treated in this way by the nurses involved. Fortunately, my father found two nurses who did their work with dedication and care, and he was satisfied with them.

Yours sincerely

Y S,2024-07,English,"Review for UZ Gent Cardiac Department.

This year, I was diagnosed with congenital heart disease known as ""Sinus Venosus ASD,"" abbreviated as PAPVR + ASD. Despite being asymptomatic, the diagnosis came as a shock. I embarked on a journey of understanding my condition and exploring potential treatments.

Through extensive research and consultations with various surgeons, I discovered three surgical options available to me:

1. Sternotomy open-heart operation.
2. Thoracotomy minimal invasion.
3. Transcatheter minimal invasion.

Choosing the right approach was a challenging decision. I would strongly advise seeking detailed consultations with surgeons to thoroughly understand the associated risks before making a choice. In my case, I personally opted for option 1, as it seemed to offer a safer solution for my specific congenital condition.

Selecting a surgeon proved to be no less complex, given that I consulted with more than 8 specialists across different countries. The key is to establish the right connection with your chosen surgeon, for me this was with Prof. Dr. Katrien Francois at UZ Gent Hospital.
Now that I've been discharged from the hospital and back in the comfort of my home, I feel fantastic and healthy. Notably, I believe I have been left with the coolest and nearly invisible scar on my chest. I am truly grateful to Professor Francois and her dedicated team for providing exceptional care throughout my journey.

No other hospital, anywhere, can match all of you in the UZ Gent Team! Your generally people-friendly, helpful hearts have already healed many ailments and wounds!
Likewise, all doctors and medical staff, from whatever service (blood collection service, PoliBas, orthopedic secretariat, internal care department of orthopedics staff, etc.) are like no other place in Belgium - I scoured enough hospitals to find out about this. to dare to express - so competent, so progressive and at the same time passionately working for people.

The tram line stops in the center at the UZ Gent domain. (See attached photo)

Melisteria,2025-07,Dutch,"Review for UZA Emergency Department – ​​Night of Friday July 4, 2025

On Friday evening, July 4, 2025, I arrived at the emergency department of UZA around 7:30 PM with a severe allergic reaction. My skin was swelling, my throat was narrowing and my entire body was covered in red spots. Nevertheless, I was placed in a room, where I had to wait for more than 5 hours before I saw a doctor. (from under a photo of my foot with the spots) this is what my entire body looked like.

When a doctor finally came in, I was told:
“What do you want us to do about this?”
A completely inappropriate response, especially for someone who was visibly in trouble. Because I was in shock, I simply replied:
“Your job.”
The doctor then disappeared “to look at my file” and was gone for more than an hour. He came back, took a quick look at the rash on my skin and disappeared again for almost an hour. Around midnight he came back with the message:
""I can't help you if you don't have a fever.""

In the meantime my condition deteriorated: my face felt paralyzed, my lips were swollen and rock hard, and I felt my throat closing up more and more. My friend and I then drove straight to the hospital in Reet (Rivierenland).

The approach there was completely different: within 10 minutes I was given an injection, an IV and I was taken seriously. The doctor there confirmed that my situation was serious and even said that if I had come 10 minutes later, things could have ended much worse.

I am writing this review in the hope that UZA takes this feedback seriously. What I experienced there was downright disappointing and dangerous. I was in a room for 5 hours with an allergic reaction that could have been life-threatening, and received hardly any help. That is not how an emergency room is supposed to work.",UZ Antwerpen,"review for uza emergency department – ​​night of friday july 4, 2025

Marie Buelens,2025-05,Dutch,"In general, I have always been satisfied with this hospital, but I still have to get this off my chest.

My mother was previously admitted to the C5 department (gastrointestinal diseases), and the nursing there was anything but professional. Whenever I rang the bell for my mother, students kept coming, which is good in itself, but from the moment there was something that the student could not solve, we often had to wait more than an hour before permanent staff arrived. When I called again after 30 minutes (also because I was leaving), the same student came again to help. When I repeated the question, the student apologized and indicated that she was going to ask again. When I walked outside I saw that the permanent staff was in the refectory and that the students were working in the nursing station.  This has happened several times. It is good to have students, but the intention is not for them to take over all the work. If I was lucky enough to speak to someone from the permanent nursing staff, they were often rude. Another time when I came to visit, there was a care going on in the room across the street. Unfortunately I could see and hear everything unwanted because the door was completely open. In addition, there was a finely built nurse who said quite loudly that she hates obese people because she destroys her back on people who don't want to do anything about their weight. I'm not one of the thinnest myself, so it was anything but nice to hear that, let's just keep quiet about how that patient must have felt. During another visit, my mother told me that the nurses had caused her a lot of pain during wound care. I don't know the exact circumstances, but my mother did indicate that the nurse shouted several times that she should not exaggerate. Then the limit was reached for me and I asked at the nursing station to speak to the head nurse. Unfortunately, the head nurse turned out not to be much different. I was allowed to tell my story at the door of the nursing station in front of everyone, instead of having to take myself aside. Every time I said the charge nurse responded defensively and indicated that her team doesn't do those things. After a while I didn't even feel like saying anything anymore.

I was very happy that my mother could return home. She had lost weight and was covered in bruises. We had home care nurses come to care for her further and luckily this went well.

I can only speak well about the doctors. The doctor in the department has also always been helpful to me. The examinations and consultations went perfectly.

Momo,2025-04,English,"At the start of a leg operation (under loco-regional anesthesia), the surgeon went straight to the wrong leg! Normally he would have noticed at one point that the leg was not marked or disinfected, but it still did not instill much confidence...

During the operation, six leg muscle samples were eventually taken, covering at least 10 cm of leg muscle and taking considerable time, whereas I had only been informed of the extraction of one or two muscle samples. As the muscle could not be anesthesised, this caused quite some discomfort.

After the operation, I had to wait for the results of the biopsy until 16.00. During all this time, I received one small bottle of water, a small pack of orange juice and a small industrial Madeleine cookie. No coffee or tea was offered, no breakfast or lunch, whereas I had not been allowed to eat or drink anything since midnight the previous day. As I could not walk, I was not able to get anything from the cafetaria. It would be good if the hospital would at least inform the patients of this Spartan regime before the operation, for instance during the prep-operative call the previous day.

I also wonder why a hospital would offer such unhealthy fare to its patients. Hospitals could contribute to healthier eating habits by setting the right example.

On the positive side, the nurses were friendly and professional, although when I had to urinate in a bed pan, I was not offered any wet (or dry) towels to clean myself afterwards.

All in all, the experience was less reassuring than at UZ Leuven, where one can sense a much more positive and welcoming atmosphere, also amongst the team members of the various teams. Clearly a better-managed hospital!",UZ Antwerpen,"at the start of a leg operation (under loco-regional anesthesia), the surgeon went straight to the wrong leg! normally he would have noticed at one point that the leg was not marked or disinfected, but it still did not instill much confidence..

during the operation, six leg muscle samples were eventually taken, covering at least 10 cm of leg muscle and taking considerable time, whereas i had only been informed of the extraction of one or two muscle samples. as the muscle could not be anesthesised, this caused quite some discomfort.

after the operation, i had to wait for the results of the biopsy until 16.00. during all this time, i received one small bottle of water, a small pack of orange juice and a small industrial madeleine cookie. no coffee or tea was offered, no breakfast or lunch, whereas i had not been allowed to eat or drink anything since midnight the previous day. as i could not walk, i was not able to get anything from the cafetaria. it would be good if the hospital would at least inform the patients of this spartan regime before the operation, for instance during the prep-operative call the previous day.

Rebecca,2024-07,Dutch,"I had a terrible experience in the neurology department where I spent a week and was traumatized. Extremely unfriendly nurses (apart from 2 nurses and 1 very sweet nurse). I suffered inhumane pain and only saw assistants. I arrived at the emergency room and was given a lumbar puncture with pressure measurement by an assistant who stabbed the wrong number numerous times and asked my mother to assist him (?). Luckily my mom went to get a nurse. After a few hours I got a horrible headache. My meninges were torn, which showed up on the scan the next day because there was a leak in my spinal cord from which cerebrospinal fluid was leaking. According to the assistant neurologist, this was due to my epidural 6 years (!!) ago and was the cause of my pain for which I went to the emergency room in the first place. This was the first diagnosis. The leak was of course the result of the improper puncture performed the day before.

Only after 3 long days was I finally able to go to the pain clinic for a blood patch, which also lasted 2 hours (!) instead of 20 minutes. 2 hours with unbearable pain and that needle in the back because they couldn't find any blood to draw.

When I was discharged I was diagnosed with migraine, which was also a wrong diagnosis as it turned out.
I became temporarily blind a few days after my discharge, but according to the assistant neurologist there was nothing wrong and that I could no longer tolerate my glasses when I was discharged. I have suffered so much unnecessary excruciating pain on top of the pain and condition I was admitted for. I didn't eat for a week, because I couldn't move or sit up and my food was just put next to my bed. I didn't wash for a whole week, because I could supposedly do it myself, even though I couldn't lift my head, let alone my body. I couldn't even go to the toilet and sometimes had to wait 1 hour for a bedpan when I rang the bell.
I had my period so I had to wear a diaper. Inhuman, as if I were in a third world country!! The doctors in the pain clinic were very friendly.

They really work against their will in the neurology department and most of them do not have an ounce of empathy and were sullen and angry. This was even confirmed by the few who do their best there. So it is known internally that it is a hell department.

A few days after my discharge I was admitted to another hospital. They had never seen such two blue arms from an IV there. Every time I was injected in the hospital, this was done very brutally, especially by the large male nurse who walked around there. My IV was leaking so had to be moved every day. This was too much trouble. One night my IV was inserted into the crook of my elbow. I had to sleep with my arm stretched out, because every time I fell asleep the alarm went off and they weren't happy about that.
One time while clearing my IV while administering my medication, the needle popped halfway out of my arm, but the nurse didn't have time so I lay there for over an hour with the blood pouring out of my vein and a needle still half way in.

Urology assistant discriminates against you in front of you and your partner about your choice not to have children and refuses you care by
by making up laws, rules, etc. on the spot and openly admitting that he discriminates against you based on age. Second opinions from several experts directly contradicted him.

Once we tested Mr.'s 'legal basis' on the spot, this turned out to be virtually untrue (we suspect that this treatment came from personal conviction) and we were quickly dismissed to prevent worse for him. VITAZ Sint-Niklaas has now helped us enormously with excellent services. I highly recommend hearing there first. In any case, I will never enter Urology at UZA again. EDIT: Dr. Claeys at VITAZ helped me very well and I was even treated twice as quickly as at the UZA, provided they had not discriminated. Karma!

Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed in thinking that the UZA was above such practices.

EDIT: After contact with the ombudsperson, it was made clear that nothing will be done about this in the interest of 'the well-being of the patient' and that a slightly younger man without children (around 25) would be better off being treated for sterilization elsewhere. They kept quiet about lying about non-existent laws and other nonsense, but I'm afraid this is not a coincidence. Even after further feedback that there was a cover-up in this regard, we received a short answer and that was it.

Dear people, you have been warned: AVOID UROLOGY HERE!!! You will be played bingo and a decision will be made *for* you instead of *with* you without taking circumstances into account. You are a number!

I wish the assistant to come and kiss my now sterile cherries. I was helped even faster in Lokeren than in the UZA thanks to his lying practices. 3 weeks faster to be precise. That's called karma.

edit: after an hour an assistant of the doctor came to speak to me, apparently the doctor was not even on the list for consultations and everything went wrong with booking the appointment and the communication from the counter afterwards. anyway, it was the first and last time. shame!",0.044,0.868,0.088,-0.9317,negative,negative,0.9993304014205933

Our 10 month baby had a severe rash after wrong advice of a pediatre and didn’t sleep all night before the MRI. She was crying her heart out and scratching her belly to blood. She was not allowed to eat or drink for 10 hours  before..We had to hold her hands to prevent her from scratching all the way to the hospital. They said pediatre will come but it turned out to be only assistant. She said she has a cream for it and she will make sure it will be put straight after procedure when the baby wakes up. The procedure was 3h late, the doctor has disappeared, none of the nurses informed us what to do. The baby woke up after anaesthesia and started itching like crazy. They said the doctor will come to examine within 30 min max or even faster. Guess what? The doctor never came, her assistant came 2 hours later only with prescription that we already had from before ( the previous doctor promised to put medicine straight away and disappeared forever). On top of that if you ask something they always say how busy they are and how they have a queue of 100 dying babies to make you feel guilty for this while 5 nurses are chatting in the reception. This is complete misguisguidance, horrific time management and false promises.

I have browsed through the reviews and I notice that many people are not satisfied with their waiting times. For these people I have a reality check.
This is a hospital, not a cash register of the GB where the first in line is also the first to leave. No. This is a hospital, here the rule is that the people who are most in danger of life get priority. So while you are waiting with your hernia or your cold sore, it is possible that the doctors are first busy with the people who have just been brought in by ambulance who have just had a serious car accident. Saving lives. I can imagine that your hernia hurts and your cold sore looks suspicious, but a broken neck and internal bleeding are just a little more urgent.
Give the staff some respect and time, if you press the bell 5 times during an urgent intervention, you may well have to wait even longer because you are forcing a member of staff to come to you.

Moreover, if you start lashing out at a hospital on Google like David Verbelen below, you should really be ashamed of yourself. ""As CEO of one of the largest companies in Belgium. Sir, you are an independent florist...

Good morning, Arjana Cools,

Thank you for your call, after 1 year and 6 months, I finally get YOU on my voicemail, and on a Friday at 7:30 AM.
The message you left or recorded is completely wrong!!!!

Now to correct this misunderstanding!!!

I want to correct this misunderstanding!!! I'm not filing a complaint against you, as you mentioned on the phone. I do expect a response to the two emails and the registered letter I sent you last year. THAT'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT than what you think!!!!

Your colleague misunderstood the phone message and passed it on. Her respect for patients is lacking... but I've heard she's learning.
Finally, I also heard she's only been working at the ombudsman's office for five months.
You should have more experience and be able to guide patients if you work at the ombudsman's office.
More self-confidence would be a plus, especially for patients when they report a problem to you.
Know your file on this matter and advise professionally... what else is an ombudsman's office for...???

I remain very friendly. Don't dismiss you. There are ombudsmen who do complete their work and you could learn a lesson from them!!!!

After 30 years at UZA, I consulted the ombudsman for the second time last year, 2016. And now I'm getting the door!!!
Your colleague before you had more experience and knew how to treat patients.
Because you're nowhere near that.
Do you think you're MORE experienced than me? We're all the same, regardless of your position.

You can keep emailing me or calling me about this. You'll always get an answer, which was hard to come by in 2016.

I'd say, put yourself in my shoes.

Boo Bee,2016-07,Dutch,"On October 5 at 4:00 PM we had an appointment with Dr. Vermander for an excision on my eye and shoulder.

Until now we have always been with Dr Van Dyck, who always treated us with respect and always informed us very well about what was going to happen and what he was going to do.

This time we had an appointment with Dr Vermander.

When we were called in we were welcomed by 2 nurses, that's what we initially thought because no one had introduced themselves.

From the moment we entered, these 2 ""nurses"" started the procedure in a rather chaotic manner without any explanation of what exactly they were going to do. (later we found out that these 2 ""nurses"" were actually doctors and one of them was Dr Van Hoof) They also didn't tell us anything that they would use a different procedure this time. Because we received no explanation, we assumed that the procedure would be the same as with Dr Van Dyck.

We realized that during this procedure, when it was too late, they used electrocautery. We would never have agreed to the use of this technique on the face, for the high risk of scarring and discoloration, which is what happened. I was also not asked if I was taking blood thinners, which should be done before using this technique.

Also during the procedure, a third person storms in without knocking and without introducing himself while I am lying half naked on the table and the first thing he does is verbally abuse our 4 year old son. This person, who turned out to be Dr Vermander, apparently had a problem with the presence of our son.

If he had a problem with something, he should have addressed us, the parents, and not our son.

At that point we didn't say anything because the other 2 people were doing an excision just above my eye, and after the procedure we were quite shocked at how abrupt Dr. Vermander was towards our son and didn't really realize what had just happened. because everything happened quite quickly. Afterwards we actually realized what had happened.

I myself, who knows a little about this procedure, even had no chance to refuse to use this on my face, but for someone who knows nothing about it, this would have been a very traumatic experience.

I have never been so humiliated and insulted.
