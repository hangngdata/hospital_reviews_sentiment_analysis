      "Very satisfied with the care of our two and a half year old little boy who was hospitalized for 11 days. When the nurse says the doctor will come, he/she is there within 30 minutes. The doctors are responsive and perform all the necessary tests quickly. The cafeteria is open every day until 7:30 p.m., which allows us to get out of the room a little. The hospital provided us with a free parking ticket per day as an accompanying parent, and there was a playroom with monitors to relieve the parents during the day. The staff is very pleasant and professional. We will definitely return to this hospital if we have any problems. The only downside is that the staff did not notify us when they put my son in \"quarantine,\" so we opened the door to air out the room, and the nurse was not happy. Conversely, they also did not notify us when they lifted the \"quarantine.\" We realized this because the nurses started entering the room without masks. This is the only communication area that needs improvement.\n",
